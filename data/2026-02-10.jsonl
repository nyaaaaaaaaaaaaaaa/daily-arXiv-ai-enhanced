The g factors of several crystal-field doublets of Pr3+ were determined. The crystal-field calculations performed using the exchange-charge model and high-resolution spectroscopy data allowed us to obtain a physically reasonable set of crystal-field parameters. The observed splitting of a number of doublets in zero magnetic field is explained by the presence of random lattice deformations. Simulation of the profiles of observed deformational doublets was carried out taking into account both hyperfine and electron-deformation interactions. The width of the distribution function of random strains was estimated. The main sources of random strains in YAl3(BO3)4:Pr3+ crystals are discussed."}

The ability to perform such spatial reformatting operations has many future applications in both classical and quantum photonics, spanning from optical communications to photonic computing and imaging. MPLCs are intricate optical systems consisting of a cascade of inverse-designed diffractive optical elements, typically separated by free-space. In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them. We experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept glass-embedded 700x700x2000 micrometer cubed MPLCs: a 3-mode and a 10-mode Hermite-Gaussian mode sorter. We discuss the fabrication challenges and future improvements of these devices. Our work plots a path towards the rapid prototyping of robust monolithic MPLC technology."}

Traditionally, these measurements are performed with grating or Fourier-transform spectrometers using incoherent light sources. Leveraging coherent light enables powerful frequency-comb-based techniques, but is limited by the technical complexity of efficiently generating broad spectral bandwidths from relatively narrowband and spectrally distant laser sources. Current visible dual-comb spectrometers require implicit compromises between optical bandwidth, experimental simplicity, and acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient dual-comb spectrometer that converts robust Er:fiber frequency combs from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet and visible with thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides. Using real-time signal processing, we retrieve coherently averaged dual-comb spectra over nearly 120 THz of simultaneous bandwidth in the visible with 100 MHz spectral resolution. With these capabilities, we measure the broadband absorption spectrum of molecular iodine (I2), demonstrating the broadest visible spectral coverage of a dual-comb spectrometer to date. Additional measurements of NO2, atomic rubidium, and atomic sodium further illustrate the achievable combination of spectroscopic bandwidth, resolution, and intrinsic frequency accuracy. Our results demonstrate the powerful integration of low-power frequency combs, nonlinear nanophotonics, and digital signal processing to enable a compact, efficient and versatile approach to high-resolution mapping of complex absorption spectra across 500 THz in the UV-visible and near-infrared spectral regions for multiple applications beyond the research lab"}

Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing.

To meet this need, Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has emerged as a noncontact, high-resolution elastography tool that probes the GHz-frequency longitudinal modulus of materials. This longitudinal modulus reflects both elastic and viscous behavior at microscopic scales. However, interpreting Brillouin spectra in biological specimens is challenging: in highly hydrated samples the Brillouin shift is dominated by water dynamics, and the GHz longitudinal modulus does not directly equate to conventional low-frequency stiffness measures (e.g. Young's or shear moduli). Debates remain about how hydration and polymer relaxation influence the Brillouin signal, and how to relate it to macroscopic biomechanics. In particular, the longitudinal viscosity measured by Brillouin scattering includes a contribution from bulk viscosity, which is absent in standard shear rheology and often overlooked. To address these issues, we used different hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures to show Brillouin spectra are modulated but not dominated by hydration. By varying gelatin concentration, we demonstrated that Brillouin shifts can either positively or negatively correlate with water content, depending on the underlying mechanical response. Measurements on ethanol water mixtures further clarify this behavior. Although the Brillouin shift varies strongly with composition, it does not follow water content monotonically and instead reflects changes in the mixture's mechanical properties. By comparing longitudinal, bulk, and shear viscosities, we also showed that bulk viscous dissipation plays a significant role in the Brillouin response. These results established a mechanical framework for interpreting Brillouin spectrum in hydrated and biomolecular systems."}

Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies."}

However, in conventional moiré lattices, the emission direction of confined modes is typically fixed, and achieving a broad range of emission angles through simple modulation remains a significant challenge. Here, we design and fabricate single-layer moiré photonic lattices into cylindrical geometries using a nanomembrane origami technique. This approach enables wide-angle localized-mode emission while maintaining stable single-mode operation and excellent spectral uniformity. The moiré supercells support localized flat-band modes under various effective twist angles, resulting in the observation of periodic localized-mode emission over a wide range of azimuthal angles. Our research provides an approach for developing moiré light sources on curved surfaces, offering significant potential in applications that demand spatial light control, including three dimensional imaging, light detection and ranging, and topological states manipulation."}

This study introduces an efficient deep learning framework incorporating transfer learning, multi-channel spectral refinement (MCSR), and Savitzky-Golay smoothing to accelerate and enhance spectral prediction accuracy. The proposed architecture leverages a pretrained MobileNetV2 model, fine-tuned to predict 102-point absorption spectra from $64\\times64$ metasurface designs. Additionally, the MCSR module processes the feature map through multi-channel convolutions, enhancing feature extraction, while Savitzky-Golay smoothing mitigates high-frequency noise. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deformable CNN models, achieving an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0245, coefficient of determination \\( R^2 \\) of 0.9578, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 32.98 dB. The proposed framework presents a scalable and computationally efficient alternative to conventional solvers, positioning it as a viable candidate for rapid spectral prediction in nanophotonic design workflows."}

Traditional correction methods often require tedious manual calibration or structured light sequences to establish pixel-wise correspondences. In this paper, we develop the Curved Surface Projection Rectification Network (CSPR-Net), a self-supervised deep learning framework for automated distortion correction. Our approach employs dual coordinate-based neural networks to learn the bi-directional mapping between the projector and camera spaces. By enforcing a robust cycle-consistency constraint, CSPR-Net autonomously resolves complex geometric transformations without requiring ground-truth deformation fields. Furthermore, a gradient-based loss function is introduced to mitigate the impact of complex ambient light interference and accurately capture high-frequency geometric variations. Quantitative evaluations in physical experimental scenarios demonstrate that CSPR-Net achieves a 20.7% improvement in end-to-end fidelity (SSIM) and outperforms the polynomial baseline by 3.8% and 5.4% in forward and inverse mapping in terms of SSIM respectively, effectively generating high-precision pre-warped images for seamless projection."}

Here, the effect of beam stirring between weakly coupled cores is observed for sub-nanosecond transform-limited pulses of several kW peak power propagating in ~10 m long 7-core fiber, for the first time to our knowledge. In contrast to low-power domain where the output power distribution in the cores is random with large fluctuations sensitive to fiber disturbances, at high power of the input pulse injected in the central core the output power becomes equalized between the cores with fluctuations reduced to <5% being insensitive to disturbances. Similar behavior is observed in cut-back experiments showing that equi-partition is approached at a distance of ~5 m. The performed modeling describes well the experimental results and clarifies mechanisms of the new effect reasoned by a large nonlinear phase shift changing along the pulse and thereby resulting in statistical averaging over the pulse length of multidirectional power transfer processes between cores, thus leading to the robust equilibrium (equi-partitition for hexagonal MCF topology). At the same time, the combined output beam measured in a far field takes a stable bell-shaped profile instead of speckled beam at low powers, similar to the beam self-cleaning effect in multimode fibers."}

The proposed architecture confines phase control to a limited section of the device, maximizing field enhancement and effective nonlinear interaction length while simultaneously reducing the overall footprint. As an example we show the results for an AlGaAs-on-insulator structure demonstrating a photon-pair generation rate of 3.16 GHz/mW in the continuous-wave regime and 5.89 MHz under pulsed pumping. The generated biphoton state exhibits a Schmidt number K=1.02, indicating nearly uncorrelated photon pairs. The compact and reconfigurable nature of this approach, together with its independence from material-specific poling techniques, makes it applicable to a broad class of integrated $χ_2$ nonlinear platforms."}

Due to its topological properties, this material has drawn a lot of attention, particularly because it hosts type-II (super-critically tilted) Dirac fermions in the $\\rm A-Γ-\\rm A$ high symmetry direction. Adopting a low-energy model fitted directly from density functional theory band structure simulations, we calculate analytically the nonlinear conductivity. We observe that third-order optical nonlinearities are efficiently modulated by the cones tilting, which produces a significant enhancement of the nonlinear susceptibility. Our results, besides shedding light on topological transitions of platinum ditelluride, are relevant for future nanophotonic devices exploiting the tunable nonlinear properties of type-II Dirac fermions."}

Here we show that coupling molecular chirality to the topological structure of twisted light generates a protected phase observable that survives strong scattering. When Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum propagate through chiral media, spin-orbit interaction converts circular birefringence into an azimuthal rotation of the helical wavefront. Remarkably, this chiral phase memory persists at scattering strengths that fully depolarize conventional beams, with the rotation magnitude preserved quantitatively between transparent solutions and strongly scattering tissue. The sign of the azimuthal rotation encodes molecular handedness: opposite enantiomers produce mirror-symmetric phase maps even after multiple scattering. Differential measurements between conjugate topological charges isolate the chiral contribution while cancelling achiral background, enabling the resolution of refractive-index changes of order 10-6. These results establish topological phase observables as robust carriers of weak chiral light-matter interactions in complex media, opening new routes for chiroptical spectroscopy and sensing beyond the ballistic-photon regime."}
