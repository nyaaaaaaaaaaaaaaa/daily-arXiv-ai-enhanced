While these technologies promise similar\nimprovements in long-range imaging applications, macroscale light-based SA\nimaging is significantly more challenging. In this work, we first demonstrate\nthat speckle noise is particularly problematic for light-based SA systems.\nSpecifically, we prove that it is fundamentally impossible to perform SA\nimaging of fully diffuse scenes if one captures sequential measurements that\nsuffer from per-measurement-independent speckle. We then develop a snapshot SA\nimaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy that can overcome\nthis limitation and enable SA imaging. Remarkably, we further demonstrate, in\nsimulation, that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency\ninformation in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures.\nThat is, one can use speckle to improve the resolution of an SA imaging system."}

Catalytic activity can be selectively modulated by tuning the\nstrength of plasmonic resonances through two primary non-thermal mechanisms:\nnear-field enhancement and hot carrier injection, which govern the population\nof energetic carrier excited or injected into unoccupied molecular orbitals. We\ndeveloped a set of polarization-sensitive metasurfaces consisting of elliptical\nAu-TiO2 nanopillars, specifically designed to plasmonically modulate the\nreactivity of a model reaction: the photocatalytic degradation of methylene\nblue. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy reveals a polarization-dependent\nreaction yield in real-time, modulating from 4.7 (transverse electric\npolarization) to 9.98 (transverse magnetic polarization) in 10 s period, as\nquantified by the integrated area of the 480 cm-1 Raman peak and correlated\nwith enhanced absorption at 633 nm. The single metasurface configuration\nenables continuous tuning of photocatalytic reactivity via active control of\nplasmonic resonance strength, as evidenced by the positive correlation between\nmeasured absorption and product yield. This dynamic approach provides a route\nto selectively enhance or suppress resonance-driven reactions, which can be\nfurther leveraged to achieve selectivity in multibranch reactions, guiding\nproduct yields toward desired outcomes."}
