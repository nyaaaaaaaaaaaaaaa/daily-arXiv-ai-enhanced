Approaches that directly generate millimeter-wave carriers are fundamentally limited by quantum and thermal phase-noise processes. Here we show that these limits can be overcome by combining Kerr-induced optical frequency division in a chip-scale microresonator with a large-spacing dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. This 3.3 THz optical reference injection-locks a Kerr soliton microcomb, with a repetition rate that becomes a coherently divided 300 GHz carrier with phase noise below the quantum limit of a corresponding 300 GHz dual-wavelength Brillouin laser and far below the thermo-refractive noise of a microring resonator. Cross-correlation phase-noise measurements were developed to show that the resulting oscillator reaches a phase-noise floor of -152 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, consistent with photodetection shot noise. Integration of the measured spectrum yields an RMS timing jitter of 135 as from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. These results establish optical frequency division as a generic method for generation of sub-terahertz carriers with coherence no longer constrained by direct-generation limits."}

The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy quark region. The critical points are determined by finite volume scaling analysis, and in the region where the sign problem is severe, the tensor renormalization group is used to investigate. As the density varies from $μ=0$ to $μ=\\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD."}

Accordingly, information-theoretic studies have emerged as a promising avenue for probing the fundamental performance bounds of of GI and related computational imaging paradigms. However, the design of information-theoretically optimal encoding strategies remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the intractability of the prior probability density function (PDF) of an unknown scene. Here, by leveraging the ability of recursively estimating the PDF of the object to be imaged via Bayesian filtering, we propose to establish an adaptive information-maximization encoding (AIME) design framework. Based on the adaptively estimated posterior PDF from previously acquired measurements, the expected information gain of subsequent detections is evaluated and maximized to design the corresponding encoding patterns in a closed-loop manner. Within this framework, the theoretical form of the information-optimal encoding under representative physical constraints is analytically derived. Corresponding experimental results show that, GI systems employing information-optimal encoding achieve markedly improved imaging performance compared with conventional fixed point-to-point imaging without relying on additional heuristic regularization schemes, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Moreover, the proposed strategy consistently enables significantly enhanced information acquisition capability compared with existing encoding strategies, leading to substantially improved imaging quality. These results establish a principled information-theoretic foundation for optimal encoding design in computational imaging paradigms,provided that the forward model can be accurately characterized."}

Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation.

This study investigates the interfacial response and bonding mechanism of sapphire and Fe-36Ni alloy joints under controlled non-optical contact conditions using burst mode ultrafast laser irradiation. A polymer interlayer was introduced between naturally stacked samples to establish a variable interfacial gap, allowing systematic evaluation of gap-dependent morphology, melting behavior, and elemental transport. By redistributing the pulse energy into sequential sub-pulses, the burst mode reconstructs the temporal energy-deposition process, yielding enhanced plasma-material coupling and stable thermal accumulation. Compared with single pulse irradiation, burst mode sustains continuous bonding across gaps exceeding 10 um--far beyond the failure threshold of the single pulse mode--and forms a fusion zone 82% larger. Fracture surface and cross-sectional analyses of SEM and EDS results confirm that sequential sub-pulses promote extensive sapphire melting, droplet-driven gap bridging, and enhanced Al-Fe interdiffusion at the interface. These results provide a scientific basis for high-gap-tolerance ultrafast laser welding and scalable integration of transparent-metal hybrid components in advanced optoelectronic and precision engineering applications."}

Integrated optical modulators that are wavelength-independent, CMOS-compatible, and capable of maintaining low waveguide losses and a high resonator quality factor, DC-coupled broadband frequency response, and low power consumption, are essential for scalable photonic integration. Yet progress towards these goals has remained limited. Here we demonstrate four types of integrated stress-optic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) silicon nitride modulators: a coil Mach-Zehnder modulator, a coil pure phase modulator, and bus-coupled and add-drop ring resonator modulators, with operation from 493 nm to 780 nm. The coil MZM operates at 532 nm with a V$π$ of 2.8V, a 0.4 MHz 3-dB bandwidth, and an extinction ratio of 21.5dB. The coil phase modulator operates at 493 nm with a V$π$ of 2.8V and low residual amplitude modulation of -34 dB at a 1kHz offset. The bus-coupled ring resonator modulator operates at 493 nm and the add-drop ring resonator modulator operates at 780 nm.

In lithium niobate waveguides, nonlinear optical processes are often limited by the so-called photorefractive effect, which limits the maximum input or output powers and impacts the nonlinear spectral response. Therefore, strategies for the management of photorefractive damage are a key consideration in device design. Usually, the photorefractive damage threshold, i.e. the maximal permissible operating power, can be increased by high temperature operation of devices. This approach, however, is not applicable in cryogenic environments, which may be required for specialized applications. To better understand the impact of photorefraction in nonlinear optical applications, we study the impact of photorefraction on the phase-matching spectra of two nonlinear-optical sum-frequency generation experiments at 1) high temperatures and 2) cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we present an approach to reduce the impact of photorefraction which is compatible with cryogenic operation. This comprises an auxiliary light source, propagating in the same waveguide, which is used to restore phase-matching spectra impacted by photorefraction, as well as reduce pyroelectric effects. Our work provides an alternative route to photorefraction management applicable to cryogenic environments, as well as in situations with tight energy budgets like space applications."}

Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity.

Its fundamental vibrational band locates around 4.6 $\\upmu$m and has larger absorption line strength than that of overtone band, which is more suitable for the precise identification and concentration detection of CO. In this paper, the up-conversion detection is employed to convert the mid-infrared absorption signal obtained by TDLAS to the visible light band, then a silicon-based detector is utilized for detection. By which, we can achieve the highest sensitivity of 79.6 ppb under the condition of cavity-free in-situ with an absorption range length of only 0.14 m. Furthermore, the single-photon level real-time detection of CO concentration after the diffuse reflection is realized by using SPAD. This work demonstrates the merits of the up-conversion detection in terms of its functionality at room temperature and capacity for sensitivity detection. Furthermore, it presents a design and optimization methodology that has the potential to underpin the advancement of the method towards more practical applications, like industrial process monitoring, medical diagnosis and so on."}

However, its practical deployment for real-world applications has been limited by architectures that rely on delicate wavelength management or phase-sensitive coherent detection. Here, we demonstrate the first multimode opto-electronic neural network (MOENN) on a silicon-on-insulator platform. By utilizing orthogonal waveguide eigenmodes as independent information carriers, our architecture achieves robust single-wavelength computation that is inherently immune to spectral crosstalk and phase noise. The fabricated MOENN chip monolithically integrates all functional components, including input encoders, programmable mode-division fan-in/-out units, and most importantly, the nonlinear multimode activation functions. We report the system's versatility through in-situ training via a genetic algorithm, successfully resolving the nonlinear decision boundaries of a two-class dataset and achieving 92.1% accuracy on the Iris classification benchmark. Furthermore, we reconfigure the MOENN into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, attaining an accuracy of 90.7% on the electrocardiogram-based emotion recognition task. This work establishes a new opto-electronic computing paradigm of simple control and excellent robustness, providing a compelling path toward scalable, deployable photonic intelligence."}
