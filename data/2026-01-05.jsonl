Accepted to SPIE Photonics West, Optical Interconnects and Packaging 2026", "summary": "In this work, we identify three considerations that are essential for realizing practical photonic AI systems at scale: (1) dynamic tensor operation support for modern models rather than only weight-static kernels, especially for attention/Transformer-style workloads; (2) systematic management of conversion, control, and data-movement overheads, where multiplexing and dataflow must amortize electronic costs instead of letting ADC/DAC and I/O dominate; and (3) robustness under hardware non-idealities that become more severe as integration density grows. To study these coupled tradeoffs quantitatively, and to ensure they remain meaningful under real implementation constraints, we build a cross-layer toolchain that supports photonic AI design from early exploration to physical realization. SimPhony provides implementation-aware modeling and rapid cross-layer evaluation, translating physical costs into system-level metrics so architectural decisions are grounded in realistic assumptions. ADEPT and ADEPT-Z enable end-to-end circuit and topology exploration, connecting system objectives to feasible photonic fabrics under practical device and circuit constraints. Finally, Apollo and LiDAR provide scalable photonic physical design automation, turning candidate circuits into manufacturable layouts while accounting for routing, thermal, and crosstalk constraints."}

Accepted to SPIE Photonics West, AI and Optical Data Sciences VII, 2026", "summary": "Photonics is becoming a cornerstone technology for high-performance AI systems and scientific computing, offering unparalleled speed, parallelism, and energy efficiency. Despite this promise, the design and deployment of electronic-photonic AI systems remain highly challenging due to a steep learning curve across multiple layers, spanning device physics, circuit design, system architecture, and AI algorithms. The absence of a mature electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain leads to long, inefficient design cycles and limits cross-disciplinary innovation and co-evolution. In this work, we present a cross-layer co-design and automation framework aimed at democratizing photonic AI system development. We begin by introducing our architecture designs for scalable photonic edge AI and Transformer inference, followed by SimPhony, an open-source modeling tool for rapid EPIC AI system evaluation and design-space exploration. We then highlight advances in AI-enabled photonic design automation, including physical AI-based Maxwell solvers, a fabrication-aware inverse design framework, and a scalable inverse training algorithm for meta-optical neural networks, enabling a scalable EPDA stack for next-generation electronic-photonic AI systems."}

In our previous work, we established that first-return probabilities in 1D scattering expand in Catalan and Motzkin numbers. Extending this to 3D anisotropic scattering requires a Boundary Truncation Factor (BTF) that takes a Cauchy kernel form. Here we explain why. Projecting the 3D walk onto the depth-optical-path plane and applying the Central Limit Theorem yields Gaussian statistics; Beer-Lambert weighting shifts the Gaussian center linearly in scattering order n, producing a Cauchy-distributed ratio. The BTF has width parameter m*(g) = 4g/(1-g) and amplitude A(g) = 1 - g(1+g)/2. Monte Carlo confirms this to 1-2% for g < 2/3. The integers 2 and 4 have geometric meaning: n=2 is the minimum scattering order for first return; the factor 4 combines exponential path-length statistics with first-passage geometry. New contributions include: (i) a projection formalism mapping 3D walks to two-dimensional phase space, (ii) a Central Limit Theorem derivation of the Cauchy BTF with explicit parameters, (iii) identification of a Poisson-Cauchy correspondence linking boundary-constrained exponential processes to heavy-tailed statistics, and (iv) generalization to oblique incidence through colored Motzkin polynomials."}

In x-cut TFLN, the TO response is inherently anisotropic, depending on both waveguide propagation angle and polarization due to the mode-specific overlap of the electric field with the ordinary and extraordinary refractive index axes of the crystal. Despite its significance, a systematic and quantitative analysis of this anisotropy has remained elusive. Here, we present the first generalized analytical model that describes the anisotropic TO response as a function of polarization and arbitrary waveguide orientation, and rigorously validate it through numerical simulations and experiments. This study provides foundational insight into anisotropic thermal tuning and enables new opportunities for engineering energy-efficient and scalable photonic design in next-generation TFLN PICs."}

Here, we utilize second harmonic generation (SHG) polarimetry to demonstrate giant anisotropic optical nonlinearities in BiTeBr and BiTeI driven by contributions to the crystals' nonlinear polarizability originating from their permanent dipole moment. In addition, using SHG microscopy, we show that BiTeI displays a distinctive SHG spatial texture consisting of thread-like regions of reduced harmonic intensity. These features demark the boundaries between phase and anti-phase polar domains, confirmed via piezoresponse force microscopy and are attributable to disorder-driven restoration of inversion symmetry and concomitant optical interference effects. Our results unveil the power of polarization-resolved SHG microscopy in elucidating the intricate relationship between structure, symmetry, and nonlinear optical responses in polar vdW materials and highlight the promise of BiTeX as a material platform for domain-engineered nanoscale nonlinear photonics."}

We construct a POD--DeepONet surrogate for the discrete band map along the standard high-symmetry path by coupling a POD trunk extracted from high-fidelity finite-element band snapshots with a neural branch network that predicts reduced coefficients. This architecture yields a compact and differentiable forward model that is tailored to the underlying Bloch eigenvalue discretization. We establish continuity of the discrete band map on the relaxed design space and prove a uniform approximation property of the POD--DeepONet surrogate, leading to a natural decomposition of the total surrogate error into POD truncation and network approximation contributions. Building on this forward surrogate, we formulate two end-to-end neural inverse design procedures, namely dispersion-to-structure and band-gap inverse design, with training objectives that combine data misfit, binarity promotion, and supervised regularization to address the intrinsic non-uniqueness of the inverse mapping and to enable stable gradient-based optimization in the relaxed space. Our numerical results show that the proposed framework achieves accurate forward predictions and produces effective inverse designs on practical high-contrast, pixel-based photonic layouts."}

The realization of truly lossless hyperbolic media, long considered as one of the key challenges of nanophotonics, unlocks new possibilities for subwavelength light focusing, strong-field physics, and novel regimes of light-matter interaction. Crucially, the proposed approach can be implemented using existing materials and readily available light sources, making it both practical and transformative."}

Unfortunately, most currently used X-ray two-dimensional (2D) detectors suffer from a fundamental trade-off between the number of pixels and readout time, making them unsuitable for fast moving objects imaging, as well as the readout dead time causes frame losses. X-ray ghost imaging (XGI) offers an alternative approach to image an object using only a highly sensitive single-pixel detector. However, a critical limitation of existing XGI methods is the excessive total acquisition time required, rendering it impractical for real applications. In this paper, we propose a rapid spatial modulation scheme based on random binary patterns encoded onto a fast-spinning mask. Clear X-ray visualization of moving objects is demonstrated with imaging rates up to 200 frames per second with a resolution of 225 um. For the first time, our method has greatly improved the XGI imaging speed and paves the way for X-ray imaging application of motion objects, such as the inspection of rotating aero-engines and in vivo medical imaging."}

However, conventional approaches to masers fail to produce emission with embedded OAM. The recent emergence of photonic time crystals (PTCs)-artificially structured media with periodically varying electromagnetic properties in time-offers a paradigm shift toward resonance-free lasing without the need for gain media. Yet, pioneering PTC designs have been based on three-dimensional bulk structures, which lack a surface-emitting configuration, and do not possess the capability to modulate OAM, thus hindering the realization of surface-emitted PTC masing that carries OAM. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of non-resonant, gain medium-free, and surface-emitted microwave vortex beam lasing OAM using ring-shaped PTCs. By developing a multiplier-driven time-varying metamaterial that achieves over 100% equivalent permittivity modulation depth, we establish momentum bandgaps (k gaps) with sufficient bandwidth to overcome intrinsic losses and enable self-sustained coherent microwave amplification. Furthermore, space-time modulation induces non-reciprocity between clockwise and counterclockwise k gap modes within the circularly symmetric PTC structure, facilitating the selective generation of microwave lasing carrying OAM-a capability beyond the reach of conventional maser technologies. Our work bridges PTC physics with coherent OAM-carrying microwave emission, establishing a transformative platform for next-generation wireless communications, advanced sensing systems, and OAM-based technologies."}

The reconstructed phase is directly projected onto a spatial light modulator for holographic replay.

In this work, we introduce nonlocal transmission line metamaterials (TL MTMs) as a versatile platform to investigate and engineer nonlocality in the microwave frequency regime. We first establish a concise theoretical framework for nonlocal TL MTMs based on circuit and network theory, from which we derive the general dispersion relation for TL MTMs having arbitrarily complex nonlocal coupling configurations. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate how such structures can be used to synthesize nearly arbitrary, even, dispersion functions within their first Brillouin zone, effectively linking nonlocal circuit parameters to prescribed dispersion profiles. Finally, we introduce time-switched nonlocal TL MTMs, a new class of metamaterials with time-varying nonlocality in which the nonlocal branches are dynamically activated as an electromagnetic pulse propagates through the structure. This platform enables complex, nearly arbitrary frequency-momentum transformations on a propagating pulse, as well as the simultaneous excitation of modes with positive, negative, and zero group velocity within the first Brillouin zone. Our results offer new physical insights into the behavior of nonlocal MTMs, a versatile platform to investigate the interplay of frequency dispersion, spatial dispersion and time modulation, and a general theoretical foundation for the design of more advanced nonlocal and time-varying electromagnetic and photonic systems."}

Our dual-ring fiber design introduces polarization-selective resonant coupling to lossy cladding modes, enabling strong polarization filtering without compromising transmission efficiency. The fiber achieves a polarization extinction ratio exceeding 21 dB and a propagation loss as low as 0.15 dB m^-1 over a 10 m fiber length. The design is scalable across wavelength bands and maintains polarization discrimination under mechanical bending, making it highly suitable for applications in fiber-based gyroscopes, quantum optics, and polarization-sensitive nonlinear interactions.
