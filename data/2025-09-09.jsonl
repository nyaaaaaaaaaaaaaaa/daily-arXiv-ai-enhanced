We find that the CSE conductivity is severely suppressed\nat low temperatures, and experiences a very sharp increase around the QCD\ncrossover transition, reaching the value of massless non-interacting fermions\nat high temperatures. This is the first non-perturbative calculation of an\nanomalous transport conductivity in physical QCD. In the case of the CME, we\nshow that this effect is not present in thermal equilibrium, in accordance with\nBloch's theorem, both for free fermions and in QCD. We emphasize the crucial\nrole of using a conserved vector current in the study of anomalous transport\nphenomena on the lattice, and how the use of non-conserved currents is behind\nnon-vanishing results for the CME in equilibrium that can be found in the\nliterature. Finally, we study the interplay between the CME and inhomogeneous\nmagnetic fields, which leads us to find a novel localized CME signal in\nequilibrium.

To\novercome this limitation, various nanostructures have recently been\ninvestigated for integration into different OLED layers, aiming to convert the\ntrapped loss modes into out-coupled light and thereby improve LEE. In this\nwork, we propose a simple yet innovative nanorod array design composed of\nmetal, insulator, and semiconductor-oxide layers, integrated on the bottom\nsurface of the OLED structure. This configuration enhances light extraction\nthrough guided surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE). Using an inverse\ndesign-based optimization approach, the structural parameters of the nanorods\nwere optimized to achieve wavelength-selective LEE enhancement. The periodic\nMIS nanorod array was optimized via the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)\nalgorithm for different emission wavelengths, yielding improvements of 29\\%,\n30\\%, and 51\\% at 440 nm, 550 nm, and 540 nm, respectively, compared with\nconventional OLEDs.
