This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $β$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\\langle L \\rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $σ^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$. The observed phase dynamics are shown to be asymptotic limits of this unified density: a ``soft'' algebraic growth $\\langle L \\rangle \\propto T^{11}$ in the 1D string-like confined regime for $N_f=0$, and a rapid $1 - \\langle L \\rangle \\propto T^{-21}$ suppression in the 3D deconfined volume for $N_f=3$. This approach provides a microscopic foundation for partial deconfinement theory and reproduces lattice QCD data with a reduced $χ^2 \\approx 1.12$, offering a rigorous reconciliation between matrix model topology and the continuous QCD crossover."}

Hall", "Samuel Alperin"], "title": "Canonical Clocks and Hidden Geometric Freedom in Self-Imaging", "comment": null, "summary": "Self-imaging represents a core hallmark of paraxial (quadratic)-wave evolution; yet, across its many realizations and generalizations over the past two centuries, the uniformity of recurrence planes along the propagation axis has been considered fundamental. However, by reframing the general phenomenon of self-imaging within its natural symplectic framework, we show that all self-imaging effects are necessarily tied to uniformly periodic recurrences in the canonical evolution coordinate -- metaplectic time -- and that the correspondence of that coordinate to the physical propagation axis represents an unexplored degree of freedom, which can be engineered arbitrarily by the initial transverse phase structure. Using a single programmable spatial light modulator, we demonstrate the construction of Talbot carpets characterized by recurrence spacings that accelerate and decelerate along the propagation axis, as well as those that follow polynomial, exponential, and sinusoidal axial trajectories, all of which preserve exact reconstruction in the canonical metaplectic time. These results establish metaplectic time as the fundamental invariant of self-imaging and reveal a regime of controllable axial dynamics previously thought to be fixed."}

Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\\sim13\\,\\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\\sim2\\,\\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science."}

By engineering slot couplers with an effectivemedium channel for impedance and modal matching, the waveguide achieves a fractional 3-dB bandwidth of 40% with a maximum coupling efficiency of 90% in the WR-2.2 band (330-500 GHz). By employing a broadband uni-traveling-carrier photodiode transmitter and sub-harmonic mixer receivers, we achieve an aggregated data rate of 0.8 Tbit/s with quadrature amplitude modulation schemes across 14 channels from 330-600 GHz. The effective-medium-slot waveguide platform yields robust broadband coupling with enhanced mechanical protection, offering reliable interconnects for ultra-high-speed terahertz integrated systems."}

Yet, direct observation of rotational dynamics at the single-molecule level in liquids remains challenging due to the trade-off between optical detectability and hydrodynamic responsiveness. Labels that are bright enough for rapid readout typically introduce excessive drag, while minimally perturbing probes are difficult to detect at high speed. This limits access to fast rotational dynamics required for direct torque measurements. Here, we introduce cylindrical-polarization-based interferometric scattering microscopy (cypiSCAT), a method encoding the orientation of anisotropic scatterers directly into a single interferometric point spread function, while intrinsically suppressing the isotropic background. We achieve rotational tracking of low-drag orientation labels based on DNA origami-attached gold nanorods with sub-degree angular precision and microsecond temporal resolution, allowing quantitative characterization of nanoscale rotational dynamics. This capability provides direct access to torque metrology at the single-molecule level, here demonstrated through the extraction of optically induced torques as small as ~1 pN nm. Relying on elastic scattering, cypiSCAT combines ultrafast temporal resolution with long observation times, making it well-suited for capturing rapid and rare rotational events and reaction steps in nanoscale biomolecular systems."}

We employed the finite element method-based COMSOL simulation and Jones-Mueller formalisms to probe the variations in optical parameters by systematically varying the angle of incidence and azimuthal angle of the incident plane wave source, thereby quantifying the variations in the polarization anisotropy parameters. The enhancement of optical properties at various resonances and the tunability of the hybridized modes are discussed. Importantly, our study reveals that despite the system being perfectly inversion-symmetric and achiral, it exhibits circular polarization anisotropy effects for non-zero finite azimuthal angles, manifested in the off-block-diagonal elements of the constructed Mueller matrices. The origin of this intriguing circular anisotropy effect is unravelled using the sequential linear birefringence and linear diattenuation effects arising from geometrical polarization transformation. Its implications in the spin-orbit interaction of light in the plasmonic crystal system are discussed."}

This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings. In doing so, we clarify the sources of discrepancies in the literature and offer a unified perspective on excited-state engineering strategies in two-dimensional TMDs."}

Here, leveraging numerical simulations validated by experimental data, we present a framework to identify the parameters that limit VIPA spectrometer resolution. This framework is applied to the construction of a new mid infrared VIPA spectrometer, tested at wavelengths near 4.6 um with both continuous-wave and frequency-comb laser sources, with a resolving power predicted by analytical expressions to be as high as RP = 830 000 (corresponding to a resolution of 78 MHz). Validated numerical simulations, however, provided a more realistic estimate that captures limits set by all the optical components. By correcting aberrations and optimizing alignment, a resolving power of RP = 440 000 (150 MHz) was experimentally achieved, corresponding to 80% of the value predicted by numerical simulation of the entire spectrometer. These results bridge the gap between analytical design expressions and experimental results for compact, high-resolution VIPA spectrometers to enable more efficient fabrication and advanced design across critical areas like applied space optics, line-by-line pulse shaping, and broadband spectral sensors."}

Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems."}

The mirror consists of a high-contrast, near-subwavelength, one-dimensional dielectric grating on a Bragg mirror. We optimized this structure using a genetic algorithm and demonstrated its robustness against geometric imperfections and oblique incidence. Experimental reflection spectra measured under normal incidence in a circular polarization basis demonstrate a more than 100-nm-wide reflection band in which more than 98% of the reflected light preserves its handedness. The total reflection coefficient reached 80%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fabricated mirror maintains high performance even under oblique incidence for angles up to $\\pm 15^\\circ$. Owing to these unique characteristics, this mirror can serve as a reflective phase plate, making it an excellent candidate for the creation of a Fabry-Pérot resonator for chiral light."}

Attosecond qubits can be prepared, coherently manipulated, and read out using existing attosecond techniques, providing a compact Hilbert-space description of strong-field dynamics beyond semiclassical trajectory pictures. A density-matrix formulation makes explicit the roles of coherence, dephasing, and decoherence, arising from continuum propagation, Coulomb interaction, infrared dressing, and macroscopic averaging, within a reduced description that remains far from thermalization. The attosecond qubits framework identifies new opportunities for ultrafast coherence metrology and for probing open quantum dynamics in strongly driven, time-dependent Hamiltonians."}
