Its nonperturbative behavior at large transverse separations ($b_{\\perp}$) remains weakly constrained due to phenomenological model dependencies. We present a first-principles determination of the CS kernel at the continuum limit and physical pion mass from lattice QCD in the large-momentum effective theory framework. Using (2+1)-flavor configurations (lattice spacings $a =(0.052-0.105$) fm, and pion mass $m_π \\approx (136, 230, 300, 320)$ MeV), we simulating the nonlocal equal-time correlation function and extract the quasi-TMD wave functions. Taking into account systematic improvements including hypercubic smearing, nonperturbative renormalization, and a $b_{\\perp}$-unexpanded matching kernel, we obtain the CS kernel at the continuum, chiral, and infinite-momentum limits. Our results are determined up to $b_{\\perp} \\sim 1$ fm, with controllable uncertainties, and agree with perturbative QCD at small $b_{\\perp}$ and global TMD phenomenological extractions. We conduct a global analysis integrated with phenomenological fits and demonstrate the impact of our results on such fits. This work yields the most precise nonperturbative constraint on the CS kernel's long-distance behavior from Lattice QCD, which not only bridges Lattice QCD, perturbation theory, and nucleon structure experiments for TMD studies, but also boosts the utility of our constraint for future global TMD analyses."}

However, achieving tunable nonlinearity at terahertz (THz) frequencies faces significant challenges due to the lack of materials that combine high nonlinear responses with strong sensitivity to external stimuli in this spectral regime. Here, we show giant modulation of THz nonlinearity by optically tailoring the valley degree of freedom in semiconductor-based metasurfaces. Mediated by the resonant behaviors of metasurfaces, photoexcited electrons transition into different valleys in the conduction band in response to the driving THz field, with the transition rate controlled by light intensity. Since THz nonlinearities vary significantly with electron dynamics in different valleys, various nonlinear effects-such as nonlinear transmission and generation-can be efficiently enhanced and modulated within a single metasurface using weak optical pumping. With optical energy as low as a few picojoules, we achieve on-off switching of THz third harmonic generation with a modulation depth exceeding 20000%, along with effective tunability of its nonperturbative behaviors. Our approach breaks new ground in active THz devices fully compatible with semiconductor industry standards, indicating a promising building block for ultrafast THz signal processing, all-optical computing, and nonlinear optical elements."}

The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $μm^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling.

However, current implementations of SEIRA approach mainly rely on complex instruments and scanning components such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and tunable external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC QCLs). Here, we present a compact and high-throughput imaging-based SEIRA platform that combines broadband gradient metasurfaces with a radiofrequency-modulated QCL that generates remarkably broad instantaneous emission spectrum (250 cm$^{-1}$) covering absorption bands of multiple distinct molecular vibrational modes. By matching the resonance spectrum of the compact (1 mm$^2$) broadband gradient metasurface with the laser emission projected on its surface through a dispersive element, we ensure that every QCL spectral component is uniquely addressed for an efficient targeted enhancement of the electromagnetic field. This enables us to use a low-cost and room-temperature mid-IR camera, acquiring in a single frame the enhanced absorption signatures of analytes deposited on the metasurface as a barcode image, thus reducing the acquisition time by up to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the FTIR and EC QCL based measurements.

Traditional approaches struggle to overcome the parasitic limitations arising from fabricating those components using different processes. Here, we report a novel 3D heterogeneously integrated optical receiver based on micro-transfer printing (μTP), enabling the co-integration of a compact bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) electronic chiplet (0.06 mm2) directly onto a silicon photonic integrated circuit (SiPIC). While previous μTP demonstrations have focused primarily on photonic integration, our work pioneers the direct integration of electronics and photonics, significantly enhancing performance and scalability. The resulting optical receiver achieves 224 Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) operation, delivering -5.2 dBm optical modulation amplitude(OMA) sensitivity at a bit-error rate (BER) of 2.4 x 10-4, a record-small footprint, and an excellent power efficiency of 0.51 pJ/b. This demonstration not only showcases the potential of μTP for high-density, cost-efficient integration but also represents a critical step toward next-generation optical interconnects in the AI era."}

From photonic quantum computers and simulators, to quantum communication and sensing, quantum states of light enable performing tasks that may outperform their best classical counterparts. Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures offer the most advanced classes of quantum light sources. Importantly, the underlying physics processes determining device performance are today fully understood, and dedicated engineering projects are currently advancing these sources towards real-world quantum technology applications. We review the performance of deterministic single-photon sources based on quantum dots in photonic crystal waveguides, the approach with the highest performance specs since it intrinsically combines suppression of leaky modes and Purcell enhancement to slow-light waveguide mode. Furthermore, we present prototype data from sources that today are commercially available and with performance metrics approaching the ideal."}

However, deviations between the anticipated target structure and the actual print often occur due to physico-chemical processes, limiting the accuracy and reliability of this technology. To minimize these deviations, we hereby present our latest research in developing different neural networks, targeting the above-mentioned aspect. Our networks are trained on several experimental as well as theoretical datasets and show good results in predicting fabrication deviations and (pre-) correcting 2.5D micro-structures. Hence, we demonstrate, that besides conventional iterative correction methods, neural networks are a promising alternative to significantly improving the output quality in DLW. Furthermore, there are no fundamental limitations to transferring this machine learning approach to other 3D printing technologies, as they all face the same challenge in terms of fidelity. To our point of view, the use of neural networks has the potential to enhance the capabilities of this technology, enabling the creation of complex structures with increased accuracy and precision in the near future."}

An additional mirror reflector, together with the mirror surface of the sample, forms a double mirror located between the pole pieces of a powerful laboratory electromagnet. The presence of an additional mirror leads to mixing of the amplitude ($ΔR/R$) and phase ($Δφ$) RMCD-components in the amplitudes of the signals at the first and second harmonics of the phase modulation. It is shown that the RMCD spectroscopy technique using a simplified scheme and an additional mirror requires the synchronous measurement of three electrical signals proportional to the amplitudes of the corresponding terms in the expression for the total intensity of monochromatic radiation detected by the photodetector: a constant signal $V_{dc}$ and high-frequency amplitudes $V_f$ and $V_{2f}$ at phase modulation frequencies $f$ and $2f$. The ratios $V_f/V_{dc}$ and $V_2f/Vdc$ determine a system of linear equations for $ΔR/R$ and $Δφ$ with known ellipsometric parameters $\\tanΨ$ and $Δ$ of the additional mirror, which are found either from additional measurements using an ellipsometer or directly (in sity) using the RMCD spectrometer itself."}

The COF-SA satisfies the free-energy criterion for bistability, enabling switching among non-lasing, continuous-wave, and mode-locking states. Two optical bistability regions are observed, including a distinctive direct mode-locking to non-lasing transition during pump down-sweep, absent in previous EDFL studies. Stable soliton-like pulses and stepwise pulse-number hysteresis further indicate first-order phase-transition-like dynamics. These results show that low-saturation intensity SAs offer a compact route to bistability-assisted pulse formation in fiber lasers."}

By imposing an edge-zero condition on the incident field, we derive compact closed-form Fresnel expressions written solely in terms of standard Fresnel integrals. The framework generalizes straightforwardly to an arbitrary number of incident plane-wave components, enabling intuitive control of the transmitted angular spectrum through interference engineered at the aperture. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the closed-form model and characterize the influence of slit geometry, wavelength, partial coherence, and Gaussian beam width. We also discuss experimental feasibility and highlight potential applications in apodization, structured illumination, beam shaping, and multiplexed sensing. Overall, the results show that multi-wave coherent illumination provides a simple and tunable route to tailoring diffraction patterns and generating propagation-robust field profiles."}

However, there exist several challenges in routinely applying FP-PAT in time-critical experiments. Among those, the need for spectral tuning of the laser between each scan position can severely limit the effective imaging speed. Here, we present an interrogation trajectory optimization approach which allows to increase the overall speed in a way that is independent of the type of interrogation laser used as well as the FP quality. Our approach provides a way to tackle speed degradation caused by hardware limitations and simplify the use of FP-PAT systems."}
