Examples include optical relays, waveguide crossings, couplers, and resonators with wavelength independent Q factors. The unconfined beams are manipulated using reflecting mirrors etched into the Si layer, which operate in the total internal reflection (TIR) regime. This approach eliminates the back-scattering and waveguide loss arising from sidewall roughness in single mode waveguides, reduces sensitivity to small dimensional variations, and reduces light induced self-heating. Although the detailed behavior of TIR at curved waveguide side wall mirror is too complex to capture by simple models, the experimental results are found to be in qualitative agreement with simple analytical calculations based on Gaussian beam theory and effective index approximations."}

While matter ranges widely from atoms, particles, to solids, photons are predominantly in a confined physical space, such as a pair of mirrors, for enhanced photon-matter interactions known as cavity QED. Since position and momentum are canonically conjugate variables governed by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a fundamental question arises - what if light confinement is in the not-so-intuitive momentum or reciprocal space? The realization of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) has made possible this exotic scenario. Here, we summarize the most recent advancements at this research frontier in optics and photonics, covering weak coupling, strong coupling, and nonlinear optics. We can designate such photon-matter interactions enabled by reciprocal light confinement through BICs with truly open systems as reciprocal QED, which holds great promise to comprehend and extend cavity QED for optics, photonics, and related fields."}

Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array. We further numerically demonstrate the transition from a perfect BIC to a leaky mode by introducing a symmetry-breaking refractive index perturbation and quantitatively analyze the resulting radiation losses. This work gives a comprehensive study of symmetry-protected BICs and provides an efficient and precise computational model for designing such BICs devices."}

The performances and the essential physical parameters of STE devices are linked to the dielectric properties of the constituent materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is an effective tool to measure these properties, but conventional analysis struggles with thin or complex multilayered systems due to simplifying approximations or complex transfer functions. In this work, we present a practical method to extract dielectric properties of STE multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). By comparing the THz pulse calculated using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with the experimentally measured pulse transmitted through the sample, we can extract the dielectric properties of STEs, enhancing THz-TDS analysis and facilitating STE design and optimization. This method avoids constructing complex transfer functions, accommodates diverse sample geometries, and is designed to be accessible, with a publicly available codebase, making it a useful tool for STE research."}

We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory."}

Here, we theoretically propose and numerically demonstrate a magneto-optical skyrmion platform enabling full polarization control of cavity eigenmodes. We reveal the correspondence between the near-field wavefunctions of degenerate dipoles and far-field polarization. By applying multidirectional magnetic fields to magneto-optical photonic crystals, we achieve any complex superposition of orthogonal eigenmodes, thereby realizing arbitrary far-field polarization. This mapping manifests as a skyrmion with a topological charge of 2, guaranteeing coverage of the entire Poincaré sphere. Our theoretical model shows excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Furthermore, we realize bound states in the continuum (BICs) with dynamically tunable polarization textures and demonstrate high-performance polarization-selective emission and transmission.

In contrast to the predominantly thermorefractive noise in silicon photonic platforms, TCCR noise represents a distinct mechanism that becomes critical for applications requiring high frequency stability and phase coherence, including optomechanical sensing, low-phase-noise microwave synthesis, and on-chip quantum squeezing. A quantitative understanding of the deterministic parameters that control TCCR noise is therefore essential for engineering the next generation of low-noise TFLN photonic systems. Here, we identify two dominant contributors to the TCCR noise in TFLN microresonators: material anisotropy and surface states. Material anisotropy results in increased noise for extraordinarily polarized optical modes and leads to a geometry dependent phase noise. Surface-state effects manifest as increased noise in higher-order transverse modes as well as more than 120-fold higher noise in suspended microresonators. Finally, we demonstrate that post-fabrication annealing -- widely used to reduce defect densities and recover crystal quality -- suppresses frequency noise by a factor of 8.2 in cladded microresonators. Together, these results establish a practical pathway for noise engineering in TFLN integrated photonic devices and accelerate their deployment in next-generation precision photonic systems."}

In this study, we propose how to realize robust photon blockade, i.e., strong photon antibunching with arbitrary detuning conditions, by combining degenerate optical parametric amplification with a hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical system. More interesting, we find near-perfect optomechanical photon blockade at room temperature, which is robust against temperature and optical dissipation. In addition, our approach can release the strict condition of high temporal resolution by combining features of conventional and unconventional photon blockade. Our approach offers a feasible route to study intriguing quantum effects in hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical systems, and holds promise for applications in nonclassical state engineering, quantum sensing, and photonic precision measurements."}

It is found that this scheme performs identically under incident illumination with either radial or azimuthal polarization. For this purpose, we use a focusing lens in combination with a diffractive optical element formed by a computer-generated hologram containing multiple alternate opaque and transparent regions. Based on vector diffraction theory, our analysis shows that the multi-zone amplitude mask redistributes the beam energy, thereby leading to the formation of a hollow beam. The proposed method provides control over the beam width which maintains a uniform dark core size after focusing through the various NA lens across all the higher order modes. Further the width of high intensity ring can be tuned by varying the NA of the focusing lens. This study shows that the proposed method is well suited for trapping particles or atoms while avoiding exposure to high central intensity, enabling improved contrast and resolution, facilitating ring-shaped ablation or heating, guiding atoms through dark regions to minimize thermal effects, and supporting information encoding using orbital angular momentum and other advanced optical applications."}

Dual to its spatial counterpart, the temporal gauge field induces a pseudo-electric field for optical pulses, leading to the spin-dependent longitudinal shift and Zitterbewegung for both trajectory and frequency. In addition, we analyze the temporal non-Abelian interference effect induced by temporally bounded non-Abelian gauge field media, which results in the temporal spin-precession and the temporal analogy of the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Our work not only fills the gap between synthetic gauge fields and time-varying physical systems, but also provides a fundamentally new approach for manipulating light with time-varying media."}

Operating at a center wavelength of 3427.43 nm, the system utilizes a differential detection strategy to enable precise, calibration-free measurements of unburned methane ($\\mathrm{CH_{4}}$) concentrations in a McKenna burner. The experimental results demonstrate a detection limit of 1.1 ppm for a 1 m path length and effectively resolve spatial concentration gradients across the combustion region. Furthermore, the system's high temporal resolution allowed for the identification of dynamic combustion instabilities, including self-sustained pulsations and fuel leakage under fuel-lean conditions.

We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a specific system: a nanobeam zipper cavity by changing the geometry of its supporting tethers. A single design parameter, corresponding to a nanoscale geometry change, controls the magnitude of the photothermal backaction and even its sign. These insights will allow engineering the combined photothermal and radiation pressure forces in nano-optomechanical systems, such that backaction-induced linewidth variations are deterministically minimized if needed, or maximized for applications that require cooling or amplification at specific laser detuning."}

Here we introduce a barrier-agnostic alternative based on coherent scattering control: a phase-locked auxiliary wave is launched from the receiver side with an amplitude and phase chosen from the measured complex scattering parameters of the barrier. In a two-port (single-channel-per-side) description, we derive closed-form conditions for (i) canceling back-reflection toward the transmitter and (ii) maximizing the net extracted power at the receiver side. In the lossless limit these conditions imply unit transmitter-to-receiver efficiency (all transmitter power is routed to the receiver side) even when the barrier is nearly opaque under one-sided illumination. We validate the concept using (1) an analytically solvable high-index Fabry--Pérot slab and (2) a numerically simulated perforated PEC metasurface exhibiting vanishing one-sided transmission; in both cases, coherent assistance yields near-unity transmission and large enhancement factors. We further analyze dissipative barriers using a receiver-side energy-balance metric, showing that substantial net delivery can persist well into the lossy regime.

One-port, loop-coupled S11 measurements supported by full-wave simulations reveal twist-driven hybridization of the dominant resonant manifold. For small G, the lower hybrid resonance redshifts continuously from 409 MHz to 210 MHz (2:1 tuning), enabling compact, twist-programmable resonant surfaces. Simulations further show that twisting imprints moire-like magnetic near-field super-modulations. From resonance frequencies, linewidths, and normal-mode splitting extracted from the complex response, we obtain normalized coupling up to g = 0.43 with cooperativity exceeding unity over broad angular ranges, meeting the resolved-splitting criterion.
