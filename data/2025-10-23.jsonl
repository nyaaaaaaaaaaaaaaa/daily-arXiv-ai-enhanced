However, these stronger measurements\nof motion are naturally accompanied by increased back-action. Here we show how\nresolving the broadband thermal noise spectrum reveals back-action-induced\ncorrelations in the noise from many mechanical modes, even those well-separated\nin frequency. As a result, the observed spectra can deviate significantly from\npredictions of the usual single-mode and (uncorrelated) multimode models over\nthe broad band, notably even at the mechanical resonance peaks. This highlights\nthat these effects must be considered in all systems exhibiting measurement\nback-action, regardless of whether the resonances are spectrally isolated or\nthe readout noise is high enough that the noise peaks appear consistent with\nsimpler models. Additionally, these correlations advantageously allow the\nthermal noise spectrum to reach a minimum -- equivalent to that of a single\nmode -- in a band far from the resonance peak, where the mechanical\nsusceptibility is comparatively stable against frequency noise."}

However, the effect is usually based on dipole resonances\nin the particles. Recently, it has been shown that quadrupole and octupole\nresonances can exhibit comparable, or even higher near-field enhancement. In\nthis work, we focus on the near-field enhancement by a metasurface composed of\ngold-disc dimers arranged in a rectangular array. We find that, owing to an\noctupole plasmon resonance coupled to a surface lattice resonance,\nexceptionally high near-field enhancement in the dimer gaps can be achieved in\nthe visible spectral range. To gain insight into the effect, we develop an\nanalytical model for the effective dipole and octupole polarizabilities of the\nparticles in an array, and discover, that at decreasing array periods, the\ndipole polarizability tends to vanish, while the octupole polarizability\nrapidly increases. Hence, octupole resonances can find applications in\nhigh-density arrays of plasmonic resonators. We propose a method to numerically\nevaluate multipole polarizabilities of a single particle, applying it to the\ngold dimer that we consider. The influence of the array on the effective\npolarizabilities is then verified by numerical calculations and a good\nagreement is obtained. Our results may open new avenues for investigating the\nproperties of periodic plasmonic structures based on higher-order multipole\nresonances and their applications."}

However, precise machining of glass\nremains a major challenge because of its brittleness and sensitivity to thermal\nand mechanical stresses. In this study, we present a novel approach that\ncombines spherical-aberration-assisted filamentation with Laser-Induced Deep\nEtching (LIDE) to achieve unprecedented high-precision micro-hole machining in\nfused silica substrates. By deliberately introducing spherical aberration into\nan intense femtosecond laser beam, thin, uniformly elongated, and stable\nfilaments are generated, which effectively suppress unwanted plasma formation\nand thermal deformation typical of standard filamentation. Using this method,\nwe fabricated micro-holes with diameters as small as 10 $\\mu$m across various\nsizes, maintaining an almost zero taper even in 1 mm-thick samples. The\nsidewalls exhibited nanoscale smoothness (Ra = 38.1 nm, RMS = 53.9 nm), and the\nhole area demonstrated excellent repeatability with only \\sim 1.0\\% variation\nacross multiple trials.

In this regime, the optical\nfrequency follows the cavity resonance, allowing frequency shifts of several\nhundred gigahertz within sub-microsecond time - independent of optical power\nand without phase-matching constraints. While a linear dependence of the cavity\nresonance on a control parameter (e.g., applied voltage) suggests that\narbitrary temporal signals could be linearly transferred to optical frequency\nchanges, we show that this assumption fails near mechanical resonances of the\nresonator. Using a millimeter-sized lithium niobate whispering gallery\nresonator with a pronounced mechanical mode at 10.5 MHz, we observe strong\ndeviations from linearity even when higher harmonics of the control signal\ncoincide with this resonance. The experimental results are in excellent\nagreement with theoretical predictions.
