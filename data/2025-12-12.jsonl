Using a time-dependent spatiotemporal propagation model with modal decomposition, we evaluate several benchmark regression and classification tasks and study the modal content of the generated speckles, which couples with a simple digital layer to perform optical computing. Analysis of modal entropy and energy-based mode counts reveals that effective computation is confined to a low-dimensional modal subspace, whose identity depends on the task and propagation regime. This also sets a trade-off between modal richness and nonlinear beam self-cleaning. These results establish modal statistics as practical design metrics for fiber-based optical computers."}

In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth. This establishes the compensated tandem TN cell as a superior and versatile platform for high-fidelity white-light singular optics."}

Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear. Our approach offers a new route to realizing skin effects in continuous, non-periodic systems and exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity, topology, and nonlinearity in macroscopic quantum states."}

Nevertheless, the influence of intermodal linear coupling on the physical properties of this bimodal structure remains to be decently revealed and harnessed. Utilizing an ultrafast fiber laser as a platform, we predict and demonstrate that the linear mode coupling (LMC) induces the deformable VS in terms of the temporal and spectral structures. Weak LMC supports heteronuclear vector solitons built of dissimilar polarization modes, i.e., a single pulse coupled to an orthogonal damped pulse chain. On the other hand, strong LMC facilitates the homonuclear VS composed of polarization modes with similar structures, in the form of soliton compounds featuring caterpillar motions. Our findings reveal new patterns of VSs and open an effective avenue for versatile ultrafast optical sources."}

Here, we extend this theoretical framework to facilitate direct computation of the full complex refractive index of water, replacing the normalized ordinate used in previous studies. Our results for the OH stretching region of H2O capture both the shapes and intensities of the experimental spectra. They reveal that inclusion of the local field effect is crucial to the accurate reproduction of spectral intensity. This extended approach enables new areas of analysis of the bulk, thin-film, and cluster spectra of water."}

The two-level estimators exhibit the expected $1/N_1^2$ scaling of the variance, up to exponential boundary effects, and achieve an exponential reduction of statistical errors at nearly the same computational cost as standard sampling. The method is tested on pure gauge ensembles, providing a controlled benchmark for its forthcoming application to dynamical QCD studies of glueball and isosinglet meson correlation functions."}

Nevertheless, the practical implementation of Kerr nonlinearity in waveguides has been constrained by the material's inherently low third-order nonlinear coefficients. Here, we present a significant advancement by demonstrating Pockels effect-induced strong Kerr nonlinearity in a periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguide. Both effective four-wave mixing (FWM) and cascaded effective FWM processes are experimentally observed. The induced FWM process achieves a remarkable maximum output power of -8.5 dBm, spanning a wavelength spectrum of over 116.8 nm. Analysis reveals that the induced effective Kerr nonlinearity exhibits a substantial effective nonlinear refractive index as $2.9\\times 10^{-15} m^{2}W^{-1}$, corresponding to an effective nonlinear refractive index enhancement factor of $1.6\\times 10^{4}$ relative to the intrinsic value. Moreover, a wavelength-converting experiment demonstrates a flat optic-to-optic response over a broadband radiofrequency spectrum, confirming that signal integrity is well preserved after on-chip effective FWM conversion. Therefore, the demonstrated efficient and broadband Pockels effect induced effective Kerr nonlinearity paves the way for novel applications in diverse fields, including spectroscopy, parametric amplification, quantum correlation studies, and wavelength conversion technologies."}

Here, we introduce a versatile time delayed DPRC framework that natively supports deep and concurrent spatiotemporal processing entirely in the optical domain. At its core, the system leverages free carrier dynamics in silicon microring resonators to provide the fundamental nonlinearity and short term memory, and these nonlinear nodes are interconnected through true time delay lines that establish shared long-term memory. Benefiting from intrinsic physical nonlinearity and multi-timescale fading memory, this simple yet effective architecture demonstrates remarkable high dimensional representation capabilities. On the NTU RGB D benchmark, the parameter efficient DPRC system achieves superior action recognition accuracies compared to mainstream deep learning models, while requiring only a single shot regression training procedure. We further verify a prototype DPRC chip that excels across diverse dataset classification and time series prediction tasks. It enables a streamlined all optical pipeline between hierarchical layers, delivering a consistent computational density of 334.25 TOPs/mm2, independent of the reservoir depth and three orders of magnitude higher than conventional approaches. Moreover, its performance scales with near-zero hardware overhead by utilizing additional wavelength channels. This DPRC network is highly scalable on a silicon photonic platform, with flexible extension to hundreds of deep reservoir layers and parallel channels, paving the way toward intelligent optoelectronic systems for advanced real time processing and parallel decision making."}

In this study, we introduce a multi-head attention network (MuHAN) to accelerate the design of ultrahigh Q-factor optical chiral resonators in bilayer metasurfaces. MuHAN achieves forward spectral predictions in approximately 10ms, thousands of times faster than finite-difference time-domain simulations, boasting 99.85% and 99.9% accuracy for forward and inverse predictions, respectively. By transferring the learned physical principles, we perform inverse design of nanoscale structures with ultrahigh Q-factors (up to 2.9910E5) based on chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) at minimal computational cost. Our rapid design tool, based on MuHAN, enables high-performance encryption imaging, bridging deep learning with high-Q chiral metasurfaces for advanced sensing, laser, and detection applications."}
