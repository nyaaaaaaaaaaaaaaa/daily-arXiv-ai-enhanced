The Fourier conjugate of this variable plays the role of a kinematic skewness in the double parton distributions. We discuss the skewness dependence of the relevant hadronic correlation functions. Using several models, we study the impact of this dependence on extracting moments of double parton distributions from existing lattice data."}

Although MoBI can be performed in a single shot, multiple exposures are typically needed to improve the quality of the result. The membrane is typically moved using a regular stepping pattern for convenience; however, the impact of the membrane movement scheme on image quality has not been fully investigated yet. In this work, we explore optimized movement strategies aiming at improving MoBI performance. An experimental study tested optimization schemes based on global and local standard deviation metrics, and compared them with regular and random stepping motions. The results demonstrated superior contrast-to-noise ratio and reduced angular sensitivity in the optimized approaches compared to conventional stepping. These results were consistent across different membrane types, with honeycomb membranes showing the highest compatibility with the optimization procedure. Noise power spectrum analysis further validated the advantages of the optimized motion strategies. Overall, the results demonstrate that an optimized membrane movement can significantly improve MoBI image quality without increasing experimental complexity."}

In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear multimode optical platforms can be harnessed to induce effective quantum interactions between photons. Through numerical experiments where quantum beams propagate alongside classical light within multimode nonlinear optical systems, we reveal the thermalization of fundamental quantum light states--specifically single- and two-photon states. This thermalization is clearly manifested by the emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans and Boltzmann statistical distributions. Beyond providing a deeper understanding of how classical nonlinearities can be used to investigate quantum many-body dynamics, our findings will enable the exploration of a broader range of complex quantum phenomena, including aspects of quantum phase transitions, within readily accessible classical optical settings."}

Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLM) offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for efficient light manipulation beyond conventional single-material metasurfaces, enabling dual-resonance cavities that can simultaneously enhance pump excitation and SPE collection. However, traditional trial-and-error and forward optimization methods face significant challenges in designing these complex structures due to the vast parameter space and computational demands. Here, we present NanoPhotoNet-Inverse, an artificial intelligence-driven inverse design framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture. This model efficiently performs inverse design of two dual-resonance MLM cavities to amplify pump and SPE emissions of different vacancies in nanodiamond and improve SPE collection. Our approach achieves inverse design prediction efficiency exceeding 98.7%, demonstrating three orders of magnitude amplification in SPE count rate and 50 picosecond lifetime, significantly surpassing conventional cavity designs. These remarkable enhancements in emission rates and collection efficiency position our platform as a transformative technology for advancing quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, quantum sensing applications, and quantum cryptography systems. Therefore, it opens new pathways for intelligent photonic device engineering in quantum technologies."}

Here, we report a broadband, high responsivity 2D and 1D photodetector formed by integrating monolayer p type WSe2 with electrospun p type NiO nanowires. The device photoresponse spans 350 to 780 nm and is governed by a nanophotonic field confinement mechanism rather than bulk optical absorption. The high index NiO nanowire acts as a dielectric Mie type nanoresonator that supports geometry defined optical modes and produces antenna like near field concentration at the nanoscale WSe2 and NiO junction. This localized optical mode increases the local absorption cross section and enhances the photocarrier generation rate within the junction region, identified as the dominant active volume for photocurrent. A coupled optoelectronic model linking full wave electromagnetic simulations to carrier generation, recombination, and extraction accurately captures the measured responsivity spectrum and its power dependence using only two electronic fitting parameters. The device achieves responsivities of 627 A/W in the visible region, 227 A/W in the UV, and 167 A/W in the NIR, demonstrating broadband operation with ultrahigh gain. These results show that geometric resonance in mixed dimensional junctions is a powerful design principle for next generation high gain optoelectronic detectors."}

In an experiment where optical tweezers are formed by OAPs, another OAP is added to form a relay configuration with an optional microscope, resulting in near diffraction-limited performance, with a resolution of $2.19$ $μm$. The severe radially non-uniform distortion incurred by this configuration, with a long path length and a large field of view, requires software corrections for the microscopic image. To avoid overfitting given the limited features available for calibration at the tweezers focal plane, a distortion model with a reduced set of parameters is selected based on simulation data. Applying the model to experimental data, an average residual error of $3.60$ $μm$ ($1.33$ $μm$) is achieved in object space after the simple relay (adding a $5 \\times$ microscope) over a field of approximately $1$ $μm$ $\\times$ $1$ $μm$ ($200$ $μm$ $\\times$ $200$ $μm$).

Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$μ$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications."}

Yet, systematic studies of its thickness-dependent reflectivity and its impact on harmonic generation are still lacking. Here, we introduce a non-destructive optical method to determine the thickness of 3r-MoS2 flakes from reflectivity measurements, offering AFM-like precision with a mean bias of less than 2 nm range, while being much faster and applicable to non-solid substrates such as PDMS, in the 3-200 nm range. Nonlinear characterization further reveals distinct thickness-dependent maxima in second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG), with the first clear peak at ~200 nm. These maxima arise from Fabry-Pérot-type phase matching conditions mediated by the film thickness and can further be shaped by absorption. This work thus provides both a practical thickness metrology and new insights for exploiting thickness-dependent 3R-MoS2 nonlinearities in scalable photonic technologies."}

Whereas the incident electromagnetic field is that of an arbitrarily polarized plane wave, the direction-dependent far-zone scattering amplitude is used to define\n  direction-dependent Stokes parameters for the scattered field. Both symmetric and asymmetric Poincaré spinors are formulated to characterize the polarization states of incident plane wave and the far-zone scattering amplitude, and two different geometric phases are defined therefrom. Density plots of both geometric phases were calculated for six different homogeneous isotropic spheres with different linear constitutive properties and boundary conditions: dielectric-magnetic spheres (non-dissipative and dissipative), impedance spheres, perfect electrically conducting spheres, charged dielectric-magnetic spheres, dielectric-magnetic spheres with topologically insulating surface states, and isotropic chiral spheres. The incident plane waves were taken to be linearly and circularly polarized, for the sake of illustration. Numerical results revealed that geometric-phase density plots possess significantly richer features than their counterparts for the differential scattering efficiency. The geometric-phase portrayals exhibit enhanced sensitivity to changes in the size and composition of the scatterer, the boundary conditions, and the incident polarization state, suggesting promise for inverse-scattering problems."}
