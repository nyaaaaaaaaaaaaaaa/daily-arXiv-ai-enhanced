We present a theory for joint coherent\ncontrol of transmission, reflection, and absorption in linear systems. We prove\nthat the numerical range provides the mathematical structure governing\nachievable responses, and reveal non-abelian effects due to non-commutativity\nbetween transmission, reflection, and absorption matrices. We provide an\nalgorithm to achieve arbitrary target responses. Our results establish a\ntheoretical foundation for joint coherent control of waves."}

By showing the\nresults of three different nanodevices as examples, it is proved that this kind\nof G-F-G nanostructure can achieve high isolation ratio AT at arbitrary\nwavelength within a certain range by designing the parameters of the structure.\nThese three nanodevices can achieve high forward transmittivities of 0.69,\n0.71, and 0.87 at the wavelengths of 714, 810, and 905 nm, respectively, and\nthe isolation ratio between forward and backward transmittivities are all more\nthan 10 dB. In addition, the effects of the incidence angle and lateral\ndisplacement of upper gratings on device performance were also investigated,\nrevealing that optimal AT is achieved under normal incidence and zero\ndisplacement.

However, its spatial resolution is fundamentally restricted to the\nmicrometer scale by the optical diffraction limit. Tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG)\nusing a scanning tunneling microscope has been developed to overcome this\nlimitation. The acquired spectra exhibit characteristic dips originating from\nvibrational responses located within the strong broadband non-resonant\nbackground (NRB), which distorts and obscures the molecular signals. By making\nthe second pulse temporally asymmetric and introducing a controlled delay\nbetween the first and second laser pulses, the NRB was effectively suppressed,\nwhich in turn amplified the vibrational response through interference and\nfacilitated the detection of weak vibrational signals. This interference also\nmade the technique phase-sensitive, enabling the determination of absolute\nmolecular orientations. Furthermore, forward- and backward-scattered signals\nwere simultaneously detected, conclusively confirming that the observed signals\noriginated from tip enhancement rather than far-field contributions. Finally,\nthe signal enhancement factor in TE-SFG was estimated to be $6.3\\times\n10^6-1.3\\times 10^7$, based on the experimental data. This phase-sensitive\nTE-SFG technique overcomes the optical diffraction limit and enables the\ninvestigation of molecular vibrations at surfaces with unprecedented detail."}

Although they emerged as a\npromising solution for achieving high-quality resonances in photonic\nstructures, quasi-BICs are confined to a very narrow range in k-space and are\nhighly sensitive to disorder. Here, we introduce quasi-bound flat bands in the\ncontinuum (quasi-BFICs), a class of optical states where Bloch modes are found\nwithin a photonic flat band, leading to a quasi-BIC behaviour at every k-point\nabove the light line. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the origin of\nquasi-BFICs from the disorder-induced band folding, mode localization and\nmultiple topological charges in k-space, and identify the optimal strength of\nstructural disorder to maximise their generation probability. Angle-resolved\ntransmission and Q-factor measurements confirm the existence of quasi-BFICs,\nopening new avenues for designing devices with high quality factor and\nwide-angle response, presenting a counterintuitive strategy that leverages\ndisorder to enhance optical performance."}

This approach\nreformulates the design as a Hermitian eigenvalue problem, efficiently yielding\noptimal beams that are physically isolated in space. Numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that under identical conditions, conventional Gaussian-enveloped\nperfect optical vortices (POVs) exhibit an average modal crosstalk of -16 dB,\nwhereas ACEs suppress crosstalk to nearly -30 dB. Moreover, the crosstalk\nsuppression of ACEs continues to improve exponentially with increasing channel\nwidth, while that of POVs saturates at a fundamental limit.
