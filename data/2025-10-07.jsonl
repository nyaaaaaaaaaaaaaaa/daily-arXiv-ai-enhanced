The growing demand for compact and\nscalable photonic systems is driving the development of MLLs on various\nintegrated photonics material platforms. Along these lines, developing MLLs on\nthe emerging thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform holds the promise to\ngreatly broaden the application space of MLLs by harnessing TFLN 's unique\nelectro-optic (E-O) response and quadratic optical nonlinearity. Here, we\ndemonstrate the first electrically pumped, self-starting passive MLL in lithium\nniobate integrated photonics based on its hybrid integration with a GaAs\nquantum-well gain medium and saturable absorber. Our demonstrated MLL generates\n4.3-ps optical pulses centered around 1060 nm with on-chip peak power exceeding\n44 mW. The pulse duration can be further compressed to 1.75 ps via linear\ndispersion compensation. Remarkably, passive mode-locking occurs exclusively at\nthe second harmonic of the cavity free spectral range, exhibiting a high pulse\nrepetition rate $\\sim$20 GHz.

Numerical simulation of THz-TDS can help understanding\nwave-matter interactions, guiding experimental design, and interpreting complex\nmeasurement data. However, existing simulation techniques face challenges in\naccurately modeling THz wave propagation with low computational cost.\nAdditionally, conventional simulation solvers often require dense\nspatial-temporal discretization, which limits their applicability to\nlarge-scale and real-time scenarios. Simplified analytical models may neglect\ndispersion, multiple scattering, and boundary effects. To address these\nlimitations, we establish a novel computational framework that integrates\nfrequency-domain physics-informed neural networks (FD-PINNs) with less\ndata-driven. To validate our proposed FD-PINNs, simulation results from\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and time-domain (TD)-PINNs were used to\ncompare with FD-PINNs. Finally, experimental results from THz-TDS systems were\nemployed to further exhibit accurate reconstruction ability of FD-PINNs."}
