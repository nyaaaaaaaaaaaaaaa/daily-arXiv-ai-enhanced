These pulses find applications in photoemission spectroscopy in condensed matter physics, pump-probe spectroscopy for high-energy-density plasmas, and attosecond science. However, optical aberrations in the high-power laser systems required for HHG degrade beam quality and reduce efficiency. We present a machine learning approach to optimize aberration correction using a spatial light modulator. We implemented and compared Bayesian optimization and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods to predict optimal Zernike polynomial coefficients for wavefront correction. Our CNN achieved promising results with 80.39% accuracy on test data, demonstrating the potential for automated aberration correction in HHG systems."}

The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering."}

While standard formulas describe the interference of circular Gaussian beams, many real systems use beams with elliptical cross sections, where differing waists and radii of curvature can reduce fringe visibility. This paper derives an analytic expression for the maximum contrast achievable between two aligned elliptical Gaussian beams, written entirely in terms of their geometric and power parameters. We then test the formula using a free-space Michelson interferometer in which all beam parameters are independently measured through beam profiling and nonlinear fitting. In our experiment, the predicted maximum contrast was 0.968 while the experimentally optimized value was 0.950. The small discrepancy is consistent with expected imperfections such as beam rotation, mode mismatch, and non-Gaussian aberrations. This work provides a practical tool for modeling and optimizing elliptical-beam interferometers."}

The model assimilates a short prefix of observed fields, conditions on a scalar source action and structure/material map, and generates closed-loop rollouts in the physical domain. Training in a symmetric-log domain ensures numerical stability. Evaluated on a reproducible FDTD benchmark (200 unique simulations, structure-wise split), FieldSeer I achieves higher suffix fidelity than GRU and deterministic baselines across three practical settings: (i) software-in-the-loop filtering (64x64, P=80->Q=80), (ii) offline single-file rollouts (80x140, P=240->Q=40), and (iii) offline multi-structure rollouts (80x140, P=180->Q=100). Crucially, it enables edit-after-prefix geometry modifications without re-assimilation. Results demonstrate that geometry-conditioned world models provide a practical path toward interactive digital twins for photonic design."}

At zero temperature the pion condensate appears at $μ_I = m_π/ 2$. Recent numerical studies at physical quark masses show that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to the meeting point with the chiral crossover line. If this result remains valid when the light quark mass (and the pion mass) goes to zero, then in the chiral limit at temperatures below the chiral transition pion condensation happens at arbitrary nonzero $μ_I$. We report on results of a lattice QCD simulation of a 2+1 flavour QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential, at smaller-than-physical light quark mass, that support this scenario."}

Dynamic radiative thermal emitters that can switch between passive cooling and heating modes offer a promising solution, but most existing devices exhibit broadband optical responses, resulting in unwanted parasitic heat exchange and limited performance. Here, we introduce an elegant strategy that uses a dielectric cap to transform broadband metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials into spectrally selective dynamic emitters. This design creates a highly tunable Fabry-Perot cavity, enabling a tailored thermal emission spectrum by engineering the reflected-wave phase profile. Our Fresnel-formalism-based phasor diagram analysis reveals two key routes for realizing high spectral selectivity: a high-index dielectric cap and a low-loss metallic MIT state, which are further validated by Bayesian optimization. Following this principle, we demonstrated a wide-angle spectrally-selective thermoregulator operating in the atmospheric transparency window (8-13 um), where the thermal emittance can be electrically tuned from about 0.2 to 0.9 through reversible copper electrodeposition on a germanium cavity. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to multispectral electrochromic windows, enabling switching between solar heating and spectrally-selective radiative cooling. Our work establishes a versatile and generalizable paradigm for spectral engineering of dynamic thermal emitters, opening opportunities in energy-efficient buildings, wearable thermal comfort, spacecraft thermoregulation, and multispectral camouflage."}

Traditional pulse characterization techniques rely on nonlinear optical processes that require high peak powers, making them unsuitable for the attojoule-to-femtojoule regime relevant to quantum photonics. Our approach utilizes a wavelength-to-time mapping method in which the arrival times of spectrally filtered components of a broadband pulse are recorded using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector and correlated via a high-resolution time-tagging system. The resulting linear relationship between wavelength and arrival time directly yields the dispersion parameter and, subsequently, the GDD. Beyond single-emitter excitation, this technique can be applied in areas such as single-photon spectroscopy, ultralow-power optical communications, and time-domain quantum control, where linear and non-destructive dispersion characterization is essential."}

Optical neural networks, capitalizing on the inherent parallelism and speed of light propagation, present a compelling solution. Nevertheless, physically realizing convolutional neural network (CNN) components all-optically remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a metasurface-based all-optical diffractive convolutional neural network (MAODCNN) for computer vision tasks. This architecture synergistically integrates metasurface-based optical convolutional layers, which perform parallel convolution on the optical field, with cascaded diffractive neural networks acting as all-optical decoders. This co-design facilitates layer-wise feature extraction and optimization directly within the optical domain. Numerical simulations confirm that the fusion of convolutional and diffractive layers markedly enhances classification accuracy, a performance that scales with the number of diffractive layers. The MAODCNN framework establishes a viable foundation for practical all-optical CNNs, paving the way for high-efficiency, low-power optical computing in advanced pattern recognition."}

This work describes a method to study the electrical noise transfer of current driver sources to the intensity noise of mid-infrared emission by commercial quantum and interband cascade lasers (QCLs and ICLs, respectively). A current driver with sub-shot electrical noise in a specific frequency range (up to 10 dB below the shot noise level) was developed for this purpose. This enables testing the performance of mid-infrared lasers when driven via such a quiet pump source. By using this novel current driver, we identify the fundamental noise of a QCL and an ICL, that is the laser intensity noise resulting solely from the internal dynamics of the laser under test. The proposed methodology allows us to retrieve the noise transfer function from current to light, showing that the main limitations in observing the quantum properties of the emitted photons come from laser excess noise and poor matching between laser and detection system in terms of bandwidth and optical power. From the analysis of the measured parameters, we highlight current technological limitations and suggest which key features should be optimized in mid-infrared systems for matching the performance required by quantum applications."}

We find dynamically stable stationary states which have two distinct flat-top regions with different intensities. These solutions represent half-vortices, where the first and second components are essentially different and, in particular, carry different topological charges: zero for one component and nonzero for the other. The typical propagation of an unstable half-vortex leads to the splitting of the central vortex core into several fragments which quasielastically interact with the boundary of the flat-top region. This behavior is interpreted as a self-bound solitary wave billiard, where the emerging fragments are the billiard balls and the flat-top region is the dynamically deforming table."}
