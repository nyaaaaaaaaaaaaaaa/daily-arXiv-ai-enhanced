Current approaches to synchronisation based on mode-locked lasers\ndeliver this level of performance but complexity, cost and size hinder their\ndeployment in facility-wide multi-node networks. Here, we demonstrate\nattosecond-level synchronisation of two chip-integrated photonic oscillators\n(microcombs) separated by 100 m of fibre. A pair of continuous-wave lasers\nestablishes a time reference that is delivered over fibre, and on-chip\nKerr-nonlinear synchronisation results in an integrated relative timing jitter\nof the microcombs below 400 as (1 kHz to 1 MHz), without any active\nstabilisation. These results unlock precision timing at scale for large\nfacilities and next-generation technologies such as disaggregated computing and\nquantum networks, and ultimately may lead to chip-integrated attosecond\nphotonics."}
