Usage of interference filters in combination with white light-emitting diode (LED) illumination enables the quantitative study of optical phenomena such as refraction, interference (e.g., Newton's rings), Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. Thus, we propose an instrument that can be used to illustrate the theoretical foundations of an undergraduate optics course and beyond."}

This attractive prospect is hindered by the lack of any topological detector, a challenging problem due to the non-orthogonal nature of the topological invariant (N). Here we demonstrate the first deterministic detector for Skyrmionic topologies of light using a deep diffractive optical neural network. Our network uses two independent processing channels of 5 diffractive layers each to map incoming topologies to spatially separated Gaussian channels from which N can be detected. We overcome the complexity of the training by using a spatial mode basis rather than pixels, reducing the training variables by x1000 compared to current methods. We use the detector on an input set of 81 input topologies, showing high accuracy even in the presence of significant levels of noise. Finally, to show the practical utility of the device, we transmit and receive an image encoded in a 14-level topological alphabet with no discernible cross-talk. Our work offers a new paradigm for the emergent field of diffractive optical networks and can easily be extended to other forms of optical topologies, setting a clear pathway for their deployment in real-world applications."}

However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were unsuitable for other applications such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q > 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (> 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing."}

OAM is generated by breaking the cross-sectional mirror symmetry of the nanowire, which creates a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by replacing the central airhole of the hollow nanowire with a cluster of 6 overlapping circular air holes with rotational offset relative to the hexagonal cross-sectional profile of the nanowire. The design parameters were then further optimized in Finite Element Method using an inverse design method to maximize the normalized OAM order |l|. We were able to realize of a cavity mode with |l| = 5.7, a mode purity of about 97%, and a Q-factor of ~250. This marks the first OAM generating active photonic device design falling within a sub-micron footprint, with additional novelties of being single component and materialistically homogeneous."}

In particular, we explore the active tuning capabilities of doped graphene, and thermally driven phase-change materials, which we compare with standard passive plasmonic structures made of gold and silver. Our results establish programmable electron-driven light sources and spectroscopic probes spanning the terahertz-to-visible range, advancing tunable metasurfaces for next-generation electron-photon technologies."}

Comments welcomed", "summary": "We present a cardinal solution for the long-standing and fundamental problem associated with the adiabatic, reversible, and controlled excitation of both dark and bright solitons in Kerr micro-resonators with normal group velocity dispersion. Our findings stem from the inclusion of a localised non-Hermitian potential, which we use to drastically reshape the characteristic collapsed snaking structure associated with such solitons. Consequently, we demonstrate a novel snaking-free bifurcation landscape where solitons of all possible widths are continuously connected via the dynamic change of the cavity detuning, and hence dissipative localised states of unprecedentedly high pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies can be excited in an adiabatic, deterministic, and reversible fashion. Our fundamental discovery has practical implications of paramount importance for frequency comb generation in all-normal dispersion cavities, which are key to comb generation in most spectral regions away from the telecom bands."}

Compared to the standard $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of Möbius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory."}

By using small, lightweight hardware comprising a high frame rate microLED array and fast single pixel detector, we report a model eye tracking system based on single pixel tracking and a specially developed set of deep learned illumination patterns. This model system is used to demonstrate eye tracking with an angular accuracy of better than one degree and a measurement rate of up to $3.59 \\,$ kHz."}

Specifically, using anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles we employ distillation with a wide operator basis which has been extensively used at zero-temperature by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration to study the charmonium spectrum. The constant contribution to some finite-temperature temporal correlation functions requires particular care with the extended operator basis common to distillation setups and we discuss this effect. As an alternative to derivative based extended operators, we also consider the use of optimal distillation profiles at finite temperature for the first time. Finally, we remark on the temperature dependence of the $1^{-+}$ spectral function by consideration of the reconstructed correlator method."}

We experimentally realize mechanical EPs up to the seventh order and confirm this architecture's scalability. Moreover, we reveal that the fundamental noise component and the measured signal share the same system coupling channel and thus undergo identical root-response amplification near EPs of arbitrary order, consistent with our signal-to-noise ratio measurements.

To that end, we evaluate in closed form the result of applying any gauge-invariant operators on the LSH basis states introduced in Part I. Classical calculations in the LSH basis run significantly faster than equivalent calculations performed using Schwinger bosons. A companion code script is provided, which implements the derived formulas and aims to facilitate rapid progress towards Hamiltonian-based calculations of quantum chromodynamics."}
