Instead of assuming specific functional forms, HoloNet learns the metric profile $A(z)$ and the gauge-dilaton coupling $f(φ)$ directly from 2+1-flavor LQCD data at $μ=0$. These learned functions are embedded into the EMD equations, enabling the model to reproduce the lattice equation of state and baryon number fluctuations with high fidelity. Once trained, HoloNet provides a fully data-driven holographic description of QCD that extends naturally to finite density, allowing us to map the phase diagram and estimate the location of the critical end point (CEP). The reconstructed potential $V(φ)$ and coupling $f(φ)$ agree quantitatively with those obtained from holographic renormalization, demonstrating that HoloNet can consistently bridge different holographic models."}

The lattice data rely on matrix elements calculated for boosted mesons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line. The calculations on this lattice ensemble correspond to two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$), using maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice volume is $32^3\\times 64$, with a lattice spacing of 0.0934 fm, and a pion mass of 260 MeV. Matrix elements are calculated for hadron boosts of $|P_3| = 0,~0.41,~0.83,~1.25,~1.66,$ and 2.07 GeV. To match lattice QCD results to their light-cone counterparts, we employ two complementary frameworks: the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and the short-distance factorization (SDF). Using these approaches in parallel, we also test the lattice data to identify methodology-driven systematics. Results are presented for the standard quark PDFs, as well as the valence sector. Beyond obtaining the PDFs, we also explore the possibility of extracting information on SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. For LaMET, we also parametrize the momentum dependence to obtain the infinite-momentum PDFs."}

We study the properties of the K$α$ fluorescence for two different short pulse durations and three X-ray incident energies below and above the K-shell absorption edge, and correlate these with incident fluence estimates based on coherent diffraction. We observe that the incident fluence of the pulse and not its duration, is the main factor that modulates the non-linear response, which leads to an effective shortening of the fluorescence emission. Our findings have implications for fluorescence-based methods for imaging single particles using transiently coherent fluorescence, or diffractive imaging through transient resonances."}

Here, we report tunable, intense, and narrowband THz radiation from ferroelectric niobium oxyhalides. Through halogen substitution and alloying, we achieve continuous and precise control over the emission frequency from 3.1 to 5.8 THz. We show that the narrowband THz radiation is driven by phonons associated with the ferroelectric polarization. We further demonstrate dynamic and nonvolatile control of the polarity of the coherent THz wave with external electric field.

Due to the self-imaging phenomenon, the SMS structure - formed by splicing a no-core fiber between two singlemode fibers -, provides a broad spectral peak whose central wavelength position is sensitive to variations in the refractive index of the medium surrounding the fiber. In turn, thanks to the in-series SMS-FPI configuration, the sensor's reflection spectrum exhibits the SMS spectral signature modulated by FPI fringes. This readily allows for reducing the width of the spectral features monitored during the sensing measurements, thus enhancing the capabilities of adequately resolving the corresponding spectral shifts. The FPIs reported in this investigation have been fabricated by using two different methods, namely by forming an air-gap FPI between the cleaved ends of two singlemode optical fibers, and by casting a polymeric film onto a connectorized fiber end tip. In the first configuration, the distance between the two cleaved fiber ends could be varied to tune the FPI's free spectral range, hence allowing for tailoring the widths of the spectral oscillations to be monitored during the sensing measurements. Alternatively, the second configuration, while avoiding the use of motorized translation stages, provides a more versatile option for applications. Thus, we understand that our work expands the application of multimode interference and FPIs in sensing scenarios, providing new opportunities for probing physical and chemical parameters by exploring their combined response."}

Here, we introduce dual-comb correlation spectroscopy (DCCS) as a powerful approach for resolving fast and intricate laser behaviors that are inaccessible to TS-DFT and conventional spectrometers. By correlating two sequences of heterodyne spectra produced by mixing a test laser with a pair of optical combs, DCCS enables rapid (e.g., 1 us) and high-resolution (0.08 pm) spectral retrieval over broad optical bandwidths. Leveraging these capabilities, we reveal mode-hopping and mode-competition dynamics in continuous-wave lasers, as well as the buildup process of a mode-locked laser. These results establish DCCS as a versatile and complementary tool to TS-DFT for exploring transient, broadband, and previously unresolvable behaviors in lasers and other time-evolving optical systems."}

Here, we resolve this problem by providing the first experimental determination of the full dielectric tensor of hyperbolic vdW MoOCl2. Via spectroscopic ellipsometry, Mueller matrix, and reflectance measurements, we quantify the material's optical duality: a metallic optical response (ε_1 < 0) along the crystallographic a-axis and a dielectric response (ε_1 > 0) along the orthogonal directions. This dichotomy drives an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) condition at \\approx 512 nm and results in giant in-plane birefringence of δn \\approx 2.2 for MoOCl2.

This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed."}

A common diffractive optical network, optimized with T phase keys, demultiplexes these encoded inputs and accurately executes any of the T distinct linear transformations at its output. We demonstrate that a diffractive network composed of N = 2 x T x Ni x No optimized diffractive features can realize T distinct complex-valued linear transformations, accurately executed for any complex field at the input aperture, where Ni and No refer to the input/output pixels, respectively.

Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases.

Unlike ideal point sources or completely incoherent thermal radiation sources, real-world light sources -- such as high-power laser diode arrays, superluminescent diodes (SLD), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography sources, and beams transmitted through atmospheric turbulence -- typically exhibit partial spatial coherence.\n  Traditional geometric optics based on ray tracing ignores diffraction and interference effects; while classical wave optics is accurate, the computational cost of handling four-dimensional correlation functions for partially coherent fields is enormous. To balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy, phase space optics provides a unified theoretical framework. By introducing the Wigner distribution function (WDF), we can map the light field into a joint space-time-spatial frequency domain $(\\bm{r}, \\bm{p})$. This description not only retains all the information of wave optics (including interference terms) but also naturally transitions to the ray description of Hamiltonian optics in the short-wavelength limit, governed by Liouville's theorem of phase space volume conservation.\n  This report aims to establish optimal modeling methods based on phase space and Hamiltonian optics for different types of extended sources such as partially coherent light, fully coherent light, and quasi-homogeneous light. The report will derive in detail the mathematical models for each source type and provide strict criteria for the applicability of geometric optics models using mathematical tools such as the Moyal expansion and generalized Fresnel number."}

Heterogeneous integration of silicon photonics and thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) combines the advantages of both platforms, and enables co-integration of high-performance modulators, photodetectors, and passive photonic components, offering an ideal route to meet these requirements. However, process incompatibilities have constrained the direct integration of TFLN with only passive silicon photonics. Here, we demonstrate the first heterogeneous back-end-of-line integration of TFLN with a full-functional and active silicon photonics platform via trench-based die-to-wafer bonding. This technology introduces TFLN after completing the full CMOS compatible processes for silicon photonics. Si/SiN passive components including low-loss fiber interfaces, 56-GHz Ge photodetectors, 100-GHz TFLN modulators, and multilayer metallization are integrated on a single silicon chip with efficient inter-layer and inter-material optical coupling. The integrated on-chip optical links exhibit greater than 60 GHz electrical-to-electrical bandwidth and support 128-GBaud OOK and 100-GBaud PAM4 transmission below forward error-correction thresholds, establishing a scalable platform for energy-efficient, high-capacity photonic systems."}

The attendant sharp field gradient ensures ponderomotive acceleration of emitted electrons and non-local light-matter interaction.

Quantifying the angular trap stiffness is essential for interpreting the rotational dynamics of probe particles. While methods for trap stiffness calibration are well established for translational degrees of freedom, angular trapping has been largely overlooked and is often assumed to behave analogously to translational dynamics. However, rotational and translational motions are sensitive to distinct experimental parameters and offer separate insights. This work covers passive analysis techniques for calibrating the angular trap stiffness and examines the influence of several factors unique to rotational optical tweezers. We show that the parameters of an ancillary measurement beam can be tuned to minimise its influence on angular trapping dynamics, while offering unprecedented improvements for nanoparticle analysis. We also explore the combined effects of shape-induced and material birefringence in spheroidal vaterite probes, and present a framework for assessing hydrodynamic and inertial contributions. These results provide a foundation for characterising rotational optical tweezers independent from translational models."}

Such modes arise due to oscillations of the waveguides in the array, periodically switching the structure between topological and trivial phases on each modulation period, so that on average it seems trivial. Localization of such modes depends on the amplitude of waveguide oscillations. Depending on the discrete rotational symmetry of the arrays with disclinations, these modes exhibit distinct spatial profiles unattainable in periodic lattices. Propagation in a medium with focusing cubic nonlinearity reveals that these Floquet states remain localized below a critical power threshold, indicating the possibility of the formation of disclination-bound Floquet solitons. Our results unveil a new regime of localization in photonic systems, bridging disclination topology, Floquet engineering, and nonlinearity."}

The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real.

To date, this scalability has been limited by the stochastic nature of the quantum light sources. Moreover, hybrid integration of different platforms will likely be necessary to combine state-of-the-art devices into a functioning architecture. Here, we demonstrate the active alignment and edge-coupling of arrays of ten site-controlled gallium arsenide quantum dots to an array of ten silicon nitride single-mode waveguides, at cryogenic temperatures. The coupling is facilitated by the fabrication of nanopillars, deterministically self-aligned around each quantum dot, leading to a high-yield and regular array of single-photon sources. An on-chip beamsplitter verifies the triggered emission of single photons into the silicon nitride chip. The low inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble enables us to observe the spectral overlap of adjacent site-controlled emitters. Across the array of waveguides, the signal collected from each coupled quantum dot is consistently and reproducibly 0.17 relative to the free-space collection from the very same single-photon source. Comparing measurement with waveguide simulations, we infer that absolute coupling efficiencies of $\\approx 5 \\%$ are currently obtained between our quantum dots and the waveguides."}

However, signals in pump-probe microscopy are typically small and often must be measured in the presence of large backgrounds. As a result, achieving measurements with a high signal-to-noise ratio is challenging, particularly when using sensors that are easily saturated, such as CMOS cameras. We present a method for enhancing signal-to-noise ratio while avoiding detector saturation. In this approach, temporally separated (sheared) reference and probe pulses transmit through a sample before and after the arrival of a pump pulse. The probe and reference pulses are then temporally recombined with opposing phases and nearly matched amplitudes, resulting in interferometric background subtraction. This recombining operation is performed by a novel common-path interferometer. Unlike previous techniques for temporal shearing, this interferometer demonstrates negligible phase and group delay dispersion with angle of incidence, allowing convenient widefield imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first common-path interferometer with such a property. We demonstrate the technique by measuring transient absorption signals in gold nanorod films with a signal-to-background ratio enhanced by over 100% and a signal-to-noise ratio enhanced by about 70%."}

In this work, we investigate the spatio-temporal equilibrium properties of incoherent multimode optical waves through the analysis of the (2+1)D Bose-Einstein thermal distribution and the corresponding classical Rayleigh-Jeans approximation. In the anomalous dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by positive temperatures. In this regime, we show that as the number of modes of the waveguide increases, the fundamental spatial mode becomes macroscopically populated, while its temporal spectrum undergoes significant narrowing, ultimately leading to complete (2+1)D spatio-temporal condensation in the thermodynamic limit. In the normal dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by negative temperature states that exhibit a hybrid character: the spatial equilibrium displays an inverted modal population, whereas the temporal spectrum remains peaked around the fundamental (carrier) optical frequency. In this regime, we predict that spatio-temporal light waves exhibit a phase transition to Bose-Einstein condensation at negative temperatures, which occurs by increasing the temperature above a negative critical value. Our work opens new avenues for future research, including the possibility for a dual spatio-temporal beam cleaning through full spatio-temporal light condensation, and lay the groundwork for the development of spatio-temporal optical thermodynamics."}
