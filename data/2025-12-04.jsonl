We calculate the specific moment of inertia and the specific deformation of the gluon matter as, respectively, the leading and next-to-leading terms in a series in angular velocity over a broad range of temperatures and various spatial boundary conditions. We show that the specific deformation, similarly to the moment of inertia, takes negative values in a phenomenologically interesting region of temperatures above the phase transition and turns positive at higher temperatures."}

Rakic"], "title": "Optical feedback induced irregular and chaotic dynamics in terahertz quantum cascade laser combs", "comment": "8 pages and 9 figures", "summary": "In this work, we systematically investigate the optical feedback dynamics of terahertz (THz) frequency combs generated from quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) using the effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations (ESMBEs). Starting from a free-running comb state at low bias (1.3Ith), we identify clear bifurcation routes as the external feedback is increased. In the weak feedback regime (C<1), the frequency comb operation remains stable; as feedback increases to the moderate feedback regime (1<C<2.4), the system transitions through frequency splitting into period-one (P1) oscillations around each comb, followed by higher-order bifurcations (P2, P4, P8). Within the range 2.4<C<13.86, only combs with P1 states are observed, with the split frequency increasing continuously with feedback strength. In the strong feedback regime (C>13.86), complex feedback dynamics re-emerged but with significantly reduced complexity compared with the weak feedback regime. More interestingly, we show that optical feedback can induce chaotic THz emission at higher bias current conditions (>1.6Ith), when the free-running laser output (C=0) is originally a stable frequency comb. The resulting chaotic dynamics, characterized by broadband spectra and large positive Lyapunov exponents, are shown to depend strongly on the linewidth enhancement factor. Although THz QCLs widely considered as ultrastable under external perturbations, this work provides the first detailed report of chaotic dynamics and routes to chaos in THz QCLs under optical feedback. These findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in THz QCLs but also open new possibilities for exploiting applications of chaotic light in THz sensing, imaging and secure communications."}

Automation is essential, and while Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) offers powerful, label-free quantitative phase imaging (QPI), its inherently noisy and low-contrast holograms make robust autofocus and object detection challenging. We present the design, integration, and validation of a fully automated closed-loop DHM system engineered for high-throughput mechanical characterization of biological cells. The system integrates automated serpentine scanning, real-time YOLO-based object detection, and a high-performance, multi-threaded software architecture using pinned memory and SPSC queues. This design enables the GPU-accelerated reconstruction pipeline to run fully in parallel with the 50 fps data acquisition, adding no sequential overhead. A key contribution is the validation of a robust, multi-stage holographic autofocus strategy; we demonstrate that a selected metric (based on a low-pass filter and standard deviation) provides reliable focusing for noisy holograms where conventional methods (e.g., Tenengrad, Laplacian) fail entirely. Performance analysis of the complete system identifies the 2.23-second autofocus operation-not reconstruction-as the primary throughput bottleneck, resulting in a 9.62-second analysis time per object. This work delivers a complete functional platform for autonomous DHM screening and provides a clear, data-driven path for future optimization, proposing a hybrid brightfield imaging modality to address current bottlenecks."}

Through cross-phase modulation between two orthogonal polarization components, each peak becomes tightly interlocked, enabling robust localization of the entire wave packet in defocusing cavities. Analysis using snakes-and-ladder diagrams demonstrates the diversity of these vector soliton families, which include dark-bright multi-peak solitons, flat-topped solitons, and modulation instability patterns, among others. Furthermore, stability analysis based on the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations reveals that specific combinations of parameters can sustain stable vector cavity solitons, whose peak numbers can be continuously tuned by adding appropriate perturbations. These findings significantly expand the scope of soliton dynamics and optical frequency comb generation in pumped-dissipative systems, independent of dispersion conditions."}

Near-petahertz fieldoscopy has recently demonstrated sub-cycle access to light-matter interactions, enabling label-free spectro-microscopy of liquids and solids with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, detection sensitivity, and dynamic range. However, current implementations still rely on temporal scanning and averaging over many laser pulses. Here, we introduce photonic time-stretch fieldoscopy, enabling single-shot electric-field detection at near-petahertz frequencies. Numerical results demonstrate that integrating fieldoscopy with a nonlinear time lens enables the real-time acquisition of ultrashort optical waveforms with a detection bandwidth approaching petahertz. The resulting large temporal aperture and attosecond resolution allow direct single-shot detection of transient electric fields generated in solid or liquid samples. This concept opens new avenues for petahertz electronics, ultrafast spectro-microscopy, and the study of dynamic, non-repetitive optical phenomena"}

It has been shown that Bi-based subwavelength optical cavities show outstanding features, including broad tuneable resonances for structural color generation and broadband perfect absorption for light harvesting. While current devices are based on continuous Bi films, integrating ultrathin films around the percolation threshold with a tailored morphology promises to enable more compact devices with a wider tunability range and/or enhanced optical response. In this context, we report the tailoring of the morphology and UV-Vis-NIR effective optical dielectric function ( $\\varepsilon$= $\\varepsilon_1$+i$\\varepsilon_2$) of ultrathin Bi films around the percolation threshold. Just below percolation, the films effective optical permittivity $\\varepsilon_1$ differs markedly from that of a continuous film, as it turns from negative to positive while its effective optical loss $\\varepsilon_2$ is reduced. We showcase the relevance of such dielectric tunability for the design of enhanced subwavelength optical cavities operating in the NIR and visible regions. In particular, we show that discontinuous near-percolation films enable designing optimized cavities for efficient colour generation with a thickness almost 3 times smaller than what was previously achieved for continuous films."}

The photoconductive material is an amorphous germanium (Ge) film deposited using DC magnetron sputtering. The antenna electrodes are composed of gold-germanium (AuGe). With the integration of a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer that acts as an electrical mask on alternate active areas, we present a simple approach to fabricate a large-area i-PCA. Along with a simplified fabrication compared to other existing designs, our approach increases the electrical robustness of the emitter and reduces the inactive gap area on the device. The i-PCA is capable of THz emission up to 2.5 THz and 36 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is promising for applications in CMOS technologies."}

Here we report on a routinely underestimated source of error in PDH offset-locking: a shift in the lock point due to the unintended interaction between residual optical sidebands and higher-order spatial modes in misaligned Fabry-Perot cavities. Significant frequency deviations-up to 50% of the cavity linewidth-can arise when the optical offset is obtained from a sinusoidally driven EOM. We measure this deviation experimentally, find agreement with a simple model, and show how a spectrally-pure frequency offset can reduce the deviation by an order of magnitude. Our findings draw attention to a systematic effect of importance to precision optical spectroscopy, optical clocks, and quantum information science."}

Consequently, its precise measurement is crucial for numerous applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Since polarization cannot be measured directly, it is typically inferred by converting it into intensity signals using dedicated optical elements. Conventional approaches, however, predominantly rely on bulky optical components, leading to considerably high fabrication costs and limited integration density. Here, we introduce a passive photonic integrated circuit capable of precisely determining the polarization state of visible free-space light. An silicon nitride on-chip architecture employing a compact polarization-splitting grating coupler and a set of passive interferometers encodes the polarization information into intensity signals, allowing conventional detectors to accurately reconstruct the polarization state. With increasing compactness of photonic components, however, susceptibility to fabrication tolerances as well as intrinsic design constraints increases, potentially leading to non\\-/ideal behaviour. To address this, we introduce a robust calibration procedure that enables precise measurements even in the presence of imperfections. The chip design, combined with the calibration procedure, offers a robust, small-footprint, and high-speed approach to polarimetry, enabling a wide range of applications."}

Unlike other mechanisms of phase conjugation, the perfect time-domain lens time-reverses both the propagating waves and the evanescent part of the spectrum. Moreover, we find that the time-reversed wave can be slowed down or accelerated, depending on the refractive index ratio. We show that this effect remains strong even when the refractive index varies arbitrarily slow, in sharp contradistinction to time-reflection which necessitates large index changes at sub-cycle rates. This is the first avenue found to yield significant negative-frequency waves using a temporal interface without the need for sub-cycle modulation or impedance matching. The effect can be used to record extreme ultrafast information and subsequently play it backwards at a slow rate, and vice-versa."}

Existing RR monitors often suffer from baseline drift over time, breaths can be occluded by limb or body movements, and many systems struggle to resolve shallow or extreme thoracic motion. Here, we propose a novel RR-monitoring sensor based on fiber-cavity attenuated phase-shift spectroscopy~(CAPS). The sensor comprises a fiber cavity whose portion is embedded into a flexible chest binder in a sinusoidal-like pattern, which the patient wears. Thoracic expansion and contraction during breathing modulate the cavity, and RR is extracted through CAPS measurements. Our sensor exhibits high reproducibility, strong sensitivity to strain and pressure induced by chest movements, inherent resistance to baseline drift, and the ability to detect body movements. The system achieves a root-mean-square error of 0.91 breaths per minute relative to the ground truth, across RR values ranging from 8 to 44 breaths per minute, when tested on multiple subjects in various postures, including sitting, supine, prone, and lateral positions. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of comprehensive optical fiber-based sleep monitoring systems."}
