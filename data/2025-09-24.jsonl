These theories\nplay an important role in proposals for completion of the Standard Model of\nparticle physics, hence the phase transition might have occurred in the early\nstages of evolution of our universe, leaving behind a detectable relic\nstochastic background of gravitational waves. Lattice field theory studies\nimplementing the density of states method have the potential to provide\ndetailed information about the phase transition, and measure the parameters\ndetermining the gravitational-wave power spectrum, by overcoming some the\nchallenges faced with importance-sampling methods. We assess this potential for\na representative choice of Yang-Mills theory with $Sp(4)$ gauge group. We\ncharacterize its finite-temperature, first-order phase transition, in the\nthermodynamic (infinite volume) limit, for two different choices of number of\nsites in the compact time direction, hence taking the first steps towards the\ncontinuum limit extrapolation. We demonstrate the persistence of\nnon-perturbative phenomena associated to the first-order phase transition:\ncoexistence of states, metastability, latent heat, surface tension. We find\nconsistency between several different strategies for the extraction of the\nvolume-dependent critical coupling, hence assessing the size of systematic\neffects. We also determine the minimum choice of ratio between spatial and time\nextent of the lattice that allows to identify the contribution of the surface\ntension to the free energy. We observe that this ratio scales non-trivially\nwith the time extent of the lattice, and comment on the implications for future\nhigh-precision numerical studies."}

The method is based on\na two-step process. An effective polarizability derived from Mie theory is\ndetermined by equating the extinction efficiency of an isolated nanoparticle\n(NP) to the extinction efficiency of an equivalent particle considering the\ndipolar limit. Then, this effective polarizability is used in the DDA framework\nto compute the optical response of an interacting particle array constituting\nthe PC structure.\n  As a particular example, the method was applied to a linear array of\ncore-shell magnetite@silica NPs to study the dependence of extinction and\nabsorption on system parameters such as core radius, shell thickness, total\nradius, interparticle separation, and size distribution. The results indicate\nthat an increase in these parameters leads to a redshift of the extinction peak\nas well as an increase in its $FWHM$.

Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser\nbeam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror\nsurpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma\nmirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from\nhigh-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality,\nand need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the\nstaging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of\n4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new\n\"windmill\" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this\ninvestigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition\nrates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a\nfunction of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and\nsurface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements.
