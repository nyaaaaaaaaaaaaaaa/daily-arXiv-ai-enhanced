Castrejón-pita", "Stephen M Morris", "Chao He"], "title": "Full vectorial field sensing using liquid crystal droplet arrays", "comment": null, "summary": "Obtaining the amplitude, phase, and polarization profiles of light beams is essential, with applications spanning metrology, microscopy, astronomy, and optical communication/computing technologies. However, most modern measurement approaches cannot retrieve these parameters easily, often relying on bulky and expensive hardware, or lacking the capability for single-shot sensing. Here, we introduce a compact, snapshot, low-cost, fully vectorial field sensor based on an inkjet-printed nematic liquid crystal droplet array to measure these properties. Polarization and intensity are measured via division-of-wavefront polarimetry, exploiting the droplets' spatially varying birefringence, while the phase is reconstructed by treating each droplet as a microlens in a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor configuration. To demonstrate the system's performance, we characterize aberrated dual-wavelength beams carrying distinct intensity, phase, and polarization information, confirming accurate retrieval of the optical field profiles for both spectral components."}

Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) is a leading solution, forming a spectrogram by scanning the delay between two pulse replicas and recording the nonlinear signal spectrum. In online settings, however, dense delay-frequency scans are costly or impractical-especially for long pulses, wavelength regimes with limited spectrometer coverage (e.g., UV), or hardware with coarse resolution, yielding severely undersampled FROG traces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle in this regime-iterative algorithms are computationally heavy, convolutional networks blur fine structure, and sequence models are unstable when inputs are discontinuous or sparse. We present a generative diffusion framework tailored to recover ultrafast pulse intensity and phase from incomplete FROG measurements. Our model infers missing spectro-temporal content with high fidelity, enabling accurate retrieval from aggressively downsampled inputs. On a simulated benchmark of FROG-pulse pairs, the diffusion approach surpasses strong CNN and Seq2Seq baselines in accuracy and stability while remaining efficient enough for near real-time deployment."}

Although topological invariants, such as crossings and linking numbers, are fundamentally invariant, recent studies reveal that their observed values deteriorate considerably in turbulent conditions due to environmental effects. In this study, we introduce an alternative approach based on the geometric stability of three-dimensional singularity line shapes, demonstrating that shape-based tracing of singularities outperforms both topological and spectral methods in turbulence. To test this concept, we propose Flower Beams, a novel class of structured optical fields featuring controllable petal-like singularity morphologies. We construct an 81-element optical alphabet and classify these structures after turbulence using deep learning. Our findings reveal that shape-based tracing achieves classification accuracy exceeding 90% in the weaker turbulence regimes and remains highly competitive even in stronger turbulence, significantly outperforming spectral and topology-based approaches. Experimental results confirm that the predicted shape stability holds in real-world conditions. This study stablishes the shape of the singularities' lines as a scalable and resilient alternative for structured light tracing and transmission, opening new avenues for turbulence-robust-applications."}

In this study, we propose a novel spectroscopic approach to directly detect the geometric phase using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) enhanced by strong light-matter interactions within an optical cavity. Focusing on a prototypical pentacene dimer undergoing singlet fission, we model the nonadiabatic wave packet dynamics as it evolves through a CI between electronically excited states. The optical cavity enables dynamic modulation of the coupling between the optical field and molecular vibrational modes, allowing precise control over the wave packet pathways. Importantly, we identify a cancellation in the spectral amplitude, arising from phase differences accumulated along different trajectories, which serves as a clear spectroscopic manifestation of the geometric phase (GP). This cavity-enhanced 2DES framework not only enables direct observation of GP effects but also offers a versatile platform for probing ultrafast nonadiabatic processes. Our results provide fundamental insights into topological effects in molecular dynamics and pave the way for experimental strategies in quantum control, photochemistry, and the design of advanced optoelectronic materials."}

Rev. Lett. 134, 201904 (2025)]. The two key ingredients that make such a calculation feasible with controlled uncertainties are: (i) the definition of lines of constant physics through the running of a non-perturbatively defined finite-volume coupling across a wide range of energy scales, and (ii) the use of shifted boundary conditions which allow a direct determination of the entropy density thus without the need for a zero-temperature subtraction. Considering the case of QCD with $N_f =3$ massless flavours in the temperature interval between 3 GeV and 165 GeV, we describe the numerical strategy based on integrating in the bare coupling and quark mass, the perturbative improvement of lattice observables, the optimization of numerical simulations, and the continuum extrapolation. Extensive consistency checks, including finite-volume and topological-freezing effects, confirm the robustness of the method. The final results have a relative accuracy of about $1\\%$ or better, and the errors are dominated by the statistical fluctuations of the Monte Carlo ensembles. We also compare our non-perturbative results with predictions from standard and hard thermal loop perturbation theory showing that at the level of $\\%$-precision contributions beyond those known, including non-perturbative ones due to ultrasoft modes, are relevant up to the highest temperatures explored. The methodological framework is general and readily applicable to QCD with four and five massive quark flavours and to other thermal observables, paving the way for systematic non-perturbative studies of thermal QCD at very high temperatures."}

Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples. Our work establishes a room-temperature excitonic platform for exploring strongly correlated many-body physics and advancing near-dissipationless, coherent quantum technologies."}

To improve mechanical strength of the sensor, a C-shaped fiber is sandwiches between two single mode fibers (SMFs) by fusion splice. The microfiber waveguide is 3D printed between two SMFs to connect two fiber cores by two-photon polymerization technology. Due to multimode property of this printed waveguide, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is obtained. This sensor exhibits a high temperature sensitivity of 361 pm/°C at 25°C to 45°C and a high air pressure sensitivity of 55 pm/kPa from 300hpa to 1000hpa. The MZI sensor features significant advantages such as small size, high stability, and easy fabrication, without the need for complex post-processing, showing great potential and broad application prospects in many sensing applications."}

It was demonstrated that frequency stabilization via external modulation can effectively avoid the transfer of modulation noise. In the experiment, two frequency stabilization methods external modulation transfer spectroscopy and internal modulation transfer spectroscopy were employed to achieve the frequency stabilization of the coupling light. The probe light noise spectra at the frequency stabilized output terminal and the detection output terminal were measured under both methods."}

To accelerate training, limited by the low refresh rate of SLMs, spatial multiplexing of the input data across different spatial channels is possible maximizing the number of available spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). Precise alignment is required in order to ensure that the same physical operation is performed across each channel. We present a semi-automatic procedure for this experimentally challenging alignment resulting in a pixel-level conjugation. It is scalable to any number of SLMs and may be useful in wavefront shaping setups where precise conjugation of SLMs is required, e.g. for the control of optical waves in phase and amplitude. The resulting setup functions as an optical DNN able to process hundreds of inputs simultaneously, thereby reducing training times and experimental noise through spatial averaging. We further present a characterization of the setup and an alignment method."}

If rotational encoders in the motors or linear encoders on the stages are available, the controller can monitor the stage position and correct it in a feedback loop. The stages can be controlled with serial commands via USB, or optionally from a remote control box that incorporates a joystick for real-time multi-axis speed control, rotary dials for fine axis positioning, and a display to indicate the stage positions. To ease adoption, we provide driver libraries in Python and C, a driver for the commonly used microscopy control software $μ$Manager, and an example graphical user interface for calibration and testing."}
