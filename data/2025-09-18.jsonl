This is generally achieved by encoding\nthe EOS time delay into a spatial, angular, or frequency coordinate. In\ngeneral, this technique operates well up to 3 THz but becomes more challenging\nfor larger bandwidths, due to dispersion and imaging imperfections. Here, we\ndemonstrate a reliable angular-encoding single shot EOS implementation that\nreaches frequencies beyond 6 THz. Diffraction simulations are used to design\nthe experimental setup and adapt this technique to commercial reflection\ngratings, removing the need for custom-built echelon mirrors. Furthermore, we\nshow that, contrary to earlier reports, group delay dispersion from angular\ndispersion does not reduce the bandwidth of single-shot EOS."}

A key ingredient in further improving\nlaser frequency stability is the use of low-noise mirror materials such as\nAlGaAs crystalline coatings. However, excess noise observed with these coatings\nlimits the performance of cryogenic silicon cavities with AlGaAs mirrors to\nsimilar levels achieved with conventional dielectric coatings. With a new pair\nof crystalline coated mirrors in a 6-cm-long cryogenic silicon cavity operated\nat 17 K, we demonstrate a clear advantage of crystalline coatings over\ndielectric coatings. The achieved fractional frequency stability of $2.5 \\times\n10^{-17}$ at 10 s is four times better than expected for dielectric mirrors and\ncorresponds to more than tenfold reduction in the coating mechanical loss\nfactor. We also combine two silicon cavities to demonstrate optical frequency\naveraging for enhanced stability. In addition, we present a long-term frequency\ndrift record of four cryogenic silicon cavities measured over several years.\nThese results open up realistic prospects for cavity-stabilized lasers with\n$10^{-18}$ fractional stability, as well as an all-optical timescale with\ncontinuously operating optical local oscillators."}

Since HHG is commonly used as a spectroscopic\ntool to probe material properties, it becomes impossible to extract information\nabout a material without introducing distortions caused by the strong driving\nfield. Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum sources have allowed HHG to be\ndriven by purely quantum fields alone. Our work focuses on controlling and\ntuning HHG emission using a weak classical driving field with energy 1000 times\nless than that used in conventional HHG experiments, perturbed by an even\nweaker quantum field, such as bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). Our technique opens\nnew avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials by minimizing issues such\nas laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. Our results show that a BSV\npulse, containing less than 0.5% of the driving laser energy, can serve as an\noptical dial for tuning nonlinear emission, electron dynamics, and ionization."}

When a beam is spatially confined by angular slits, the\nuncertainty in its orbital angular momentum (OAM) increases, leading to the\ngeneration of OAM sidebands. Both the angular slit number and the angular slit\nwidth shapes the spatial confinement of the beam. In this study, we investigate\nthis dependence of the OAM sidebands by obstructing a Gaussian beam with $N$\nnumber of evenly spaced angular slits with angular separation\n$\\Delta\\theta_{sep}$. The power distribution among the OAM sidebands exhibits\noscillatory behavior as a function of $\\Delta\\theta_{sep}$. We find that the\nnumber of oscillations over the full range $0 \\leq \\Delta\\theta_{sep} \\leq\n2\\pi/N$ is given by the ratio $\\frac{|l|}{N}$.
