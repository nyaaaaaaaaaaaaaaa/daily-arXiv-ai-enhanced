Previous approaches to gaseous diffractive optics relied on the simultaneous excitation of a standing acoustic wave and an entropy mode to produce one-dimensional periodic structures. However, the presence of acoustic oscillations in the gas imposes stringent constraints on some operational parameters of these optical elements, such as their lifetime and diffraction angle. In this work, we introduce a new approach that eliminates the acoustic mode, relying solely on the entropy mode. This enables control of the lifetime and temporal profile of gaseous optical elements, and also allows the creation of arbitrary structures with greater contrast, including non-periodic patterns such as chirped gratings or lenses. This approach should allow operation over a wider parameter space, including larger diffraction angles and compatibility with laser pulse durations ranging from femtoseconds to microseconds."}

Here, breaking the reliance on materials, we present twistronics in higher-dimensional free space, where the twisted lattice is not a layer of 2D material but a 3D propagating light field with topological textures. Moiré structured light with a twist angle can generate a rich set of high-dimensional topologies, including skyrmionium bags, skyrmion bag superlattices, skyrmion clusters, and optical quasicrystals, with controllable symmetry. Many of these textures have not been reported before. Importantly, in contrast to prior moiré superlattices, our freespace optical moiré textures maintain their topologies over a long propagation distances, showing nondiffractive behavior and robustness against perturbations and obstacles. Our work unlocks higher dimensions to manipulate moiré photonics with high-capacity topologies to address modern challenges of robust information transfer and encryption."}

However, despite significant advances in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), the practical deployment of these systems remains constrained by the bulky nature of essential RF components (e.g., bulky antennas, amplifiers, and cables), especially in covert, conformal, and space-constrained applications. To overcome these limitations, monolithic electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs), enabling miniaturized and synergistic integration of both RF and photonic components, are gaining notable attention. As a groundbreaking advancement, we demonstrate a novel photonic RF receiver that monolithically integrates a bow-tie antenna and a microring modulator on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. The chip innovatively leverages dual-resonance enhancement mechanism, RF resonance from the antenna and optical resonance from the microring, to significantly boost the RF-to-optical conversion efficiency. A record-high figure of merit (FOM) of 3.88 W-1/2 is achieved within a compact footprint of 2*1.7 mm2. As the first demonstrations, the integrated receiver is deployed in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, achieving centimeter-level radar ranging accuracy and 3.2 Gbps wireless communication capacity, as well as real-time video transmission function in moving scenarios. This seminal work paves a new way for covert, conformal, and miniaturized frontends in wireless communication and sensing applications, including body area networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed vacuum maglevs, and electronic warfare systems."}

To address this, we developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results. ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background. This framework makes axial super-resolution imaging more accessible by providing an easy-to-deploy algorithm that avoids additional hardware costs and complexity, showing great potential for live cell studies and clinical histopathology."}

Self injection locking (SIL) enables direct driving of soliton microcombs by integrated lasers, providing turnkey initiation and improved coherence, but it also pins the pump close to resonance, limiting both spectral span and tuning flexibility. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency. These advances expand the spectral reach and controllability of integrated soliton microcombs for information processing and precision metrology."}

We model ultrafast topological dynamics in an ITO/SiO$_2$/Ag multilayer supporting hybrid epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)-plasmon modes. Using a time-dependent Drude-Lorentz permittivity for ITO and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, it is found that carrier relaxation with a 10-ps time constant redshifts the ENZ resonance from 490 to 525~nm and shifts the reflection-phase singularities across the angle--wavelength plane. The motion of these singularities corresponds to the displacement of exceptional points and a discrete change in the cumulative winding number. The transient Floquet-like band structure exhibits avoided crossings and Dirac-type dispersions driven by ENZ modulation. The results directly link picosecond-scale permittivity dynamics to quantized topological transitions in non-Hermitian photonic systems."}

Wavefront shaping enables control over scattered light by modulating the incident wavefront, but its application in living tissue is hindered by tissue-induced temporal decorrelation. This study systematically investigated the real-valued intensity transmission matrix (RVITM), a high-speed wavefront shaping method, for light focusing across a broad range of speckle decorrelation times. The inherent trade-off between static light focusing enhancement and implementation speed is characterized, which provided practical guidelines for implementing RVITM in real-time wavefront shaping under varying dynamic conditions. Effective optical focusing using a RVITM with 33 ms runtime was achieved through porcine liver with decorrelation times as short as 13 ms, demonstrating feasibility for biologically relevant dynamics and supporting the development of adaptive, non-invasive optical control for biomedical applications."}

This theoretical framework integrates the geometric formalism of transformation optics with the thermodynamic principles found in quantum dissipative systems. This concept goes beyond traditional coordinate transformations by affecting the distribution of quantum energy and entropy in a coherent thermodynamic manner as well as reshaping electromagnetic fields. By employing the thermofield dynamics approach, we establish new rules that show how local energy and entropy densities are influenced by the Jacobian determinant of the mapping. This indicates that when the geometry is compressed, it increases the generation of quantum energy and entropy density, while expansion has the opposite effect, all while adhering to the laws of conservation and the second law of thermodynamics.\n  As a practical test, we reformulate the Casimir effect within this framework, yielding a continuous pressure law that connects the quantum and classical realms via a thermal weighting function. This relationship illustrates how both geometry and temperature jointly determine quantum pressure. Additionally, our numerical results for Drude-Lorentz metamaterials support our analytical predictions and align closely with the comprehensive Lifshitz-Matsubara formulation. In fact, QTTO offers a powerful and coherent platform for exploring energy, entropy, and quantum pressure in real-world dissipative media. Beyond our immediate findings, it opens up a systematic pathway for managing quantum thermal processes and controlling field fluctuations in metamaterials and curved optical environments."}

The device is theoretically analyzed and experimentally fabricated on a SOI platform. Theoretical analysis predicts periodic Fano-like resonances with a high extinction ratio and a steep slope rate, arising from strong coherent optical mode interference within a compact resonator comprising two SIs and a connected feedback waveguide. Experimental results align with the theoretical model, validating the expected resonance behavior and confirming the effectiveness of the design. These findings underscore the potential of compact coupled SIs for generating Fano-like resonances, enabling broader applications in integrated photonics."}

However, its realization in metasurfaces has been restricted to circularly polarized light, confining geometric phase metasurfaces to helicity-dependent operation and excluding them from the linear-polarization domain that dominates modern optics. In this work, we overcome this limitation by harnessing exceptional points of non-Hermitian physics. We introduce and experimentally realize quasi-exceptional-point metasurfaces that exploit engineered singularities to directly impart a geometric phase onto linearly polarized light. Proof-of-principle demonstrations with gratings and holograms confirm broadband and high-fidelity wavefront shaping across arbitrary linear polarizations, which has not been achieved with previous phase modulation approaches. By revealing an intrinsic connection between geometric phase and non-Hermitian photonics, our work resolves a long-standing theoretical impasse and establishes a new framework for high-dimensional light control, opening opportunities for scalable polarization optics, advanced imaging, holography, optical communications, and integrated photonics."}

By adjusting pump energy, we induce a transition from uniform angular photoluminescence to a strongly directional emission peak at large angles in the amplified spontaneous emission and RL regimes. This directionality arises from enhanced spatial coherence in the strong scattering regime, enabling coupling of guided random-laser modes to high-angle diffraction through the metasurface grating. Our system demonstrates wide-angle RL beam steering at submicron scale without complex external components. These results provide a straightforward method to control RL emission directionality, advancing tunable coherent light sources and metasurface-based photonic applications."}

We introduce GiBS (Generative Input-side Basis-driven Structures), an inverse-design framework that represents the entire device using a compact set of coefficients from smooth parametric bases such as Fourier or Chebyshev functions. This formulation compresses the design space by more than an order of magnitude, enabling efficient optimization of complex, broadband, and aperiodic geometries. GiBS integrates this low-dimensional representation with an autoencoder-based manifold-learning workflow to map the relationship between geometry and optical response, facilitating rapid exploration, discovery of high-performance designs, and systematic analysis of fabrication sensitivity. The inherent smoothness of the basis functions ensures manufacturability while capturing the asymmetry required for nonlocal optical interactions. We experimentally validated the framework through the realization of a PEDOT:PSS broadband scattering metasurface, whose measured response closely matched full-wave simulations across 500-1100 nm. These results establish GiBS as a scalable, data-efficient, and fabrication-aware platform for the inverse design of multifunctional metasurfaces, bridging AI-guided representation learning with experimentally realizable photonic architectures."}
