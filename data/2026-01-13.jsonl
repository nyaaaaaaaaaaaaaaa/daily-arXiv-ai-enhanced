This regime is somewhat reminiscent of the Cherenkov regime, in which the velocity of a charged particle exceeds the phase velocity of light in a medium. However, because it involves two media and a moving interface, it gives rise to richer and more complex scattering dynamics, with a single scattered wave when the incident wave propagates in the same direction as the interface and three scattered waves when they propagate in opposite directions. Existing studies address only limited non-magnetic configurations, and a general formulation has yet to be established. In this paper, we present a complete and general solution to scattering in the interluminal regime using a symmetric decomposition approach based on subluminal and superluminal limit interfaces, together with a space-time impulse response. This approach provides clear physical insight into the scattering features of the interluminal regime. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between the subluminal and superluminal regimes and elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying interluminal scattering."}

We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability."}

We classify topologically trivial photonic bands using SRSIs, treating them as the fundamental building blocks of 3D photonic band structures. This means that if certain bands cannot be constructed from these building blocks, they are necessarily topological. Furthermore, we distinguish between photonic and electronic band structures by analyzing which SRSI values are allowed in systems with and without polarization singularity. We also explore the impact of the polarization singularity on the behavior of Wilson loops, providing new insights into the topological classification of 3D photonic systems."}

We discuss the properties of the phase transition at high-density, considering an effective theory describing the high-density heavy-quark limit of QCD. This effective theory is a simple model in which the Polyakov loop is a dynamical variable, and the quark Boltzmann factor is controlled by only one parameter, $C(μ,m_q)$, which is a function of the quark mass $m_q$ and the chemical potential $μ$. The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy-quark region. As the density varies from $μ=0$ to $μ=\\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD."}

SCNet combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with material-aware routing, wavelet-based frequency decomposition to separate structure from speckle across sub-bands, and a curriculum-style optimization that progressively enforces spectral consistency before spatial fidelity.

We validate SCNet on 3D plastic objects over varying working distances, resolve 5.66 lp/mm on a paper USAF target, and restore fine structures on leaves and metal surfaces. On rabbit heart and kidney tissues, SCNet improves recovery of low-contrast anatomical texture under the same ultrathin collection constraint.

Conventional methods using Bézier clipping are computationally prohibitive, and a previously proposed mirror surface subdivision method suffered from the computation time increasing with mirror curvature. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel calculation method based on Fermat's principle that directly and efficiently determines the reflection point by minimizing the optical path length from a point light source to a hologram pixel via the mirror surface, using Newton's method for optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces computation time compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, it enables the rendering of multiple reflections from several mirrors, a capability that was challenging for conventional techniques."}

We evaluate the photonic quasicrystal accurately by a generalized spectral method that embeds the quasiperiodic structure into a higher-dimensional periodic system. We study the spectral distribution of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals and find some interesting phenomena. As the computational resolution N increases, there are more eigenvalues within finite frequency bandwidths, and the maximum localization always occurs at spectral gap edges for states near index N + 1. By varying βwithin the range of (0,1), we present a butterfly-shaped spectral structure with abundant band gaps. We find that the spectral structure factor Q (defined as I_{mg}/N, where I_{mg} is the maximum gap index) exhibits different linear patterns as βchanges: Q = 1 - βwhen β< βc, while Q = βwhen β> βc, where βc \\approx 0.424 is the transition point. This linear relationship holds robustly in the strong quasiperiodic regime (βaway from 0 or 1) and is independent of the specific type of irrational number used. The relationship disappears (weak quasiperiodic regime) near β= 0 or β= 1. It demonstrates that the intrinsic spectral properties of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals are fundamentally governed by the magnitude of the irrational parameter β."}

To ensure practical applicability, we present a system-level solution including both this hardware innovation and an accompanying automatic error-resilient configuration algorithm. The algorithm compensates for the lack of continuous tunability inherent in the non-volatile hardware design, thereby enabling such new operational paradigm without compromising performance, and also ensuring robustness against fabrication errors.

We identify the optimal conditions for efficient vortex light transmission, analyze the influence of detuning on transmission efficiency and phase distortion, and specifically examine the scenario where the control field carries OAM the latter being essential for a complete characterization of OAM conservation in the FWM process, while all three aspects have been largely overlooked in the existing literature.

The method combines inverse-designed microstructured phase masks with photopolymer resins engineered for controlled optical absorption. By precisely tailoring the phase-mask topography, we generate arbitrary 3D light-intensity distributions within the resin, including intentionally encoded dark regions that define hollow internal features. Simultaneously, the resin formulation is designed to balance optical penetration with sufficient local energy deposition to achieve high-fidelity polymerization throughout the volume. Using this approach, millimeter-scale architectures comprising more than $10^{6}$ addressable voxels are fabricated in a single 7.5~s exposure, corresponding to a volumetric throughput of $\\sim$1~mm$^{3}$/s ($>10^{5}$~voxels/s). The demonstrated performance is presently limited by resin kinetics and illumination geometry rather than by the phase-mask framework itself.

The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices."}

Since the inception of microresonator-based nonlinear optics, related studies have focused primarily on regimes in which photons with distinct resonant modes can interact. Although multiple comb lines can occupy a single resonance during the Kerr comb formation process, their mutual interactions have remained largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a Kerr comb formation that is confined to a single resonance of a microresonator via dual-pumping. MHz-scale comb-line spacing reveals previously unobserved Kerr-comb dynamics, featuring parametrically driven phase multistability that can be observed directly in the temporal domain. Two laser pumps serve as phase-coupled references for heterodyne read-out, simplifying the measurements."}

However, scaling these systems has been prevented by the high power consumption and thermal crosstalk of conventional volatile phase shifters. Here, we demonstrate the first non-volatile field-programmable photonic gate array, implemented on a hybrid silicon-barium titanate platform. Unlike traditional thermo-optic devices that require constant power to maintain a state, our device utilizes ferroelectric domain switching to provide non-volatile memory, allowing optical circuits to be programmed and retained without any holding power or electrical bias. The hexagonal waveguide mesh integrates 58 programmable unit cells and 116 actuators, achieving nanosecond-scale switching speeds of 80 nanoseconds while reducing static power consumption to negligible levels (560 nanowatts per π phase shift). To validate this platform, we configured the mesh to perform diverse signal processing functions, including tunable filtering, 4x4 linear unitary transformations, and optical routing. This work establishes non-volatile ferroelectric silicon photonics as a scalable, heat-free platform essential for the next generation of energy-efficient photonic computing."}

In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\\,μ$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures."}

Here we demonstrate a self-optimizing multichannel optical computing architecture based on multi-plane light conversion that natively processes RGB images and structured numerical data throughout the optical domain. We introduce two complementary optimization strategies that enable autonomous performance adaptation without differentiable forward models. First, Bayesian optimization tunes channel mixing coefficients to minimize crosstalk and enhance feature separability at the input level. Second, a hardware-in-the-loop protocol based on self-organized criticality leverages avalanche dynamics to autonomously navigate the high-dimensional phase landscape, enabling the system to self-optimize through stochastic multi-scale perturbations. Across medical imaging, natural image classification, and regression tasks, multichannel processing with random phase masks improves accuracy by 26--58 percentage points over raw pixel baselines, with RGB systematically outperforming grayscale by 5--6 percentage points. Self-optimization strategies provide additional gains of 6--7 percentage points through autonomous adaptation at complementary system levels. Our work establishes self-optimizing multichannel optical computing as a practical platform for real-world machine learning applications."}

Here we report the demonstration of a monolithically integrated optical receiver in 45nm CMOS, where efficient multi-layer optical demultiplexing with capacitive tuning, energy efficient electronics and wideband inverse designed grating couplers enable implementation of a 32-channel receiver chip based on wavelength-division multiplexing. The chip operates at an aggregate data-rate of 1.024 Tb/s with all channels operating simultaneously at a data-rate of 32 Gb/s/channel achieving a record energy efficiency of 71 fJ/b, including the power consumption of both the electronic circuitry and the tuning and control of photonic devices, and a record bandwidth density of 4 Tb/s/mm2. The receiver achieves a bit-error-rate below 1E-12 without requiring equalization, error correction or digital processing. Inverse-designed broadband grating couplers provide efficient, low-loss optical coupling into the chip. An on-chip demultiplexer, composed of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and ring resonators, offers a large channel-to-channel isolation sufficient for error-free operation. Capacitive phase shifters embedded within the ring resonators of the demultiplexer are used for wavelength alignment at a zero static power consumption. MZIs and ring-resonators are periodically selected and autonomously locked to the wavelength of the corresponding optical carrier. The implemented monolithic receiver offers a scalable, energy-efficient and reliable solution for the beyond Tb/s optical interconnects."}

We first optimize regular polygonal structures to suppress the photonic density of states and find that the best performing polygon is consistent with a tiling of space with hexagonal unit cells. We next show that introducing cavities into hexagonal structures further suppresses the photonic density of states, particularly when the cavity is also hexagonal. Such a result would find application in the design of fiber-optic cables. We then describe an approach for optimizing arbitrary x-simple or y-simple designs that can recover finite supercells of a hexagonal unit cell. Our approach can therefore discover the symmetry of photonic-crystal primitive unit cells that significantly suppress the photonic density of states for a given set of material parameters within a single optimization."}

In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band."}
