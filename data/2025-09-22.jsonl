We present a unified neural-network\napproach that learns these distributions directly from matrix elements\ncalculated via numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the\nlattice by fitting two complementary inputs simultaneously: data matched to\nphysical quantities via known momentum-space and coordinate-space formalisms.\nUtilizing data from both methods stabilizes the extraction and mitigates biases\nthat can arise when either is used alone. We validate the method on controlled\nmock data and apply it to lattice-QCD matrix elements to extract parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs). We show benefits of such an approach for\ndetermining the physical quantities. We further extend the framework to\nzero-skewness generalized parton distributions and demonstrate nucleon\ntomography within the same neural-network parameterization.

Its principal limitation, however, is\nthat it yields only sheared phase-difference measurements rather than the\nabsolute phase, thereby requiring additional reconstruction step. In this work,\nwe introduce OSI-flex, a flexible, open-source computational framework for\nquantitative phase reconstruction from sheared phase-difference measurements.\nThe method leverages modern machine learning tools, namely automatic\ndifferentiation and the advanced ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer.\nThe method simultaneously estimates the phase and shear values, enabling it to\nadapt to experimental conditions where the shear cannot be precisely\ndetermined. Because defining shear value is inherently difficult in most\nsystems, yet crucial for effective phase reconstruction, this joint\noptimization leads to robust and reliable phase retrieval. OSI-flex is highly\nversatile, supporting arbitrary numbers, magnitudes, and orientations of shear\nvectors. While optimal reconstruction is achieved with two orthogonal shears,\nthe inclusion of regularization - specifically total variation minimization and\nsign constraint - enables OSI-flex to remain effective with nonorthogonal or\neven single-shear measurements. Moreover, OSI-flex accommodates a wide range of\nshear magnitudes, from subpixel (differential configuration) to several dozen\npixels (semi-total shear configuration). Validation with simulations and\nexperimental data confirms quantitative accuracy on calibrated phase objects\nand demonstrates robustness with 3D-printed cell phantom and follicular thyroid\ncells."}

Specifically, by integrating graphene sheets into the unit\ncell of metallodielectric superlattices, the presence or absence of topological\ninterface modes can be dynamically controlled by tuning the permittivity of\ngraphene via electrical gating. These topological modes emerge when the spatial\naverage of the permittivity of the superlattices is negative and vanish as the\nchemical potential of graphene is adjusted to render the averaged permittivity\npositive. The dependence of the existence of topological interface modes on the\nsign of the spatial average of the permittivity is fundamentally related to the\nemergence of a Dirac point, which arises when the averaged permittivity of the\nsuperlattices reaches zero and is accompanied by the Zak phase transition, thus\nresulting in the appearance and disappearance of topological interface modes.\nFurthermore, we find that the propagation constant of topological interface\nmodes decreases when increasing the chemical potential of graphene. The\nrobustness of such topological interface modes is also demonstrated. Our work\nprovides clear physical insights and offers a promising approach to the dynamic\ncontrol of topological interface modes."}
