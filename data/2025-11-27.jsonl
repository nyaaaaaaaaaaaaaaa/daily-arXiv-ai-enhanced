Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \\ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit."}

By engineering temporal modulations at the interfaces of hyperbolic media, we achieve isolation between forward and backward beams while preserving the hallmark property of negative refraction. Two complementary approaches are developed: in the optical regime, a multilayer AZO/ZnO hyperbolic slab is sandwiched between permittivity-modulated dielectric layers (3D time crystals); in the microwave regime, a wire medium is sandwiched between time-modulated resistive metasurfaces (2D time crystals). Both designs exploit Floquet harmonic expansions and are validated with a customized harmonic-balance finite-element solver. We report isolation exceeding 46 dB in the optical device and ~11 dB in the microwave counterpart. This work introduces a general framework for nonreciprocal negative refraction across frequency regimes, expanding the design space of time-varying metasurfaces and photonic time crystals."}

Computational testing reveals that this accelerated model achieves an ${\\sim}4000$x increase in computational speed compared to the CMT model while preserving a high accuracy in key figures-of-merit such as output power and amplification efficiency.

Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies."}

Draft submitting for \"Optics and Lasers in Engineering.\"", "summary": "Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry. This makes weighted integer shear averaging a practical and accurate tool for wavefront reconstruction when fractional shear is unavoidable."}

It is shown that, similar to the case of the passage of long-wavelength neutrons through a refractive sample, the accelerated motion of a crystal results in a change in neutron energy. The physical nature of the phenomenon in both cases is determined by the difference in the Doppler frequency shift at the entrance and exit of the wave through the sample. The difference between the case of ordinary refraction of long-wavelength neutrons and the case of wave passage through a crystal under conditions where diffraction has a dominant influence on the nature of wave propagation is only quantitative. The results obtained are qualitatively consistent with the available experimental data."}

Dynamic and reconfigurable metalenses are key to next-generation flat-optics platforms, yet their practical realization remains limited by slow response, optical loss, and polarization sensitivity. The integration of chalcogenide phase-change materials with metasurface architectures offers a powerful platform for dynamic optical tunability, owing to materials such as Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) that can reversibly switch between amorphous and crystalline states with distinct refractive indices. However, the strong optical absorption of crystalline GST in the visible to near-infrared range has hindered its widespread use in reconfigurable metalenses. In this study, we design an all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurface based on hybrid Si--GST nanostructures to realize a dynamically tunable bifocal metalens operating at 1.55 μm. The device achieves a variable focal length from 70 μm to 200 μm, with focusing efficiencies of 30% in the amorphous state and 20% in the crystalline state, as validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we show that flat-top laser excitation enables uniform, reversible phase transitions within tens of nanoseconds -- amorphization in approximately 13~ns and crystallization in approximately 90~ns -- without mechanical motion or electrical bias. For next-generation metasurfaces intended for uses including beam steering, dynamic holography, optical routing, multi-depth imaging, and optical communication, this method shows great promise due to its control and stability."}

In this study, we demonstrate a monolithic Z-cut lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) microring platform that enables simultaneous generation of tunable multi-chromatic microlasers and Raman-assisted soliton microcombs. Exploiting the strong Raman activity and high second-order nonlinearity of LNOI, we engineered a dispersion-optimized microring with a loaded Q factor of 3.86X10^6, facilitating on-chip efficient broadband coherent light source. A novel phase-matching configuration with all the waves of the same ordinary polarization was realized for the first time in this platform, feasibly enabling modal-phase matched Raman-quadratic nonlinear processes that extend lasing signals into the visible spectrum. Under continuous-wave laser pumping at 3.73 mW in the telecom band, we achieved a Raman-assisted soliton comb centered at 1624.49 nm with record-low pump threshold on the LNOI platform. Concurrently, multi-chromatic Raman lasing outputs were observed at ~1700, ~813, and ~535 nm within the same microring. The system exhibited efficient wavelength tuning of these multi-chromatic laser signals through a 5 nm shift in pump wavelength.

This method leverages inherent information from the optical field, enabling precise beam alignment with a simple structure and minimal computational effort. In the 3D measurement experiment, the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.99 for transverse offsets in the x- and y-directions, and 0.98 for air gap in the z-direction. The RMSE in x-direction, y-direction and z-direction is respectively 0.135 μm, 0.128 μm and 2.42 μm. The time for a single 3D displacement calculation is 4.037e-4 seconds. Furthermore, it facilitates single-step displacement regulation with a deviation tolerance within 0.15 μm and modal content regulation with an accuracy of 4.67%.

Here, we report a low-dose deep-UV lensless holographic microscopy platform that uses standard board-level CMOS sensors designed for visible light, eliminating all imaging optics and dedicated DUV detectors. Our system achieves large field-of-view (up to 116 mm2) DUV imaging with low illumination and label-free phase and chemically specific amplitude contrast. A specialized defocus/wavelength diverse pixel super-resolution reconstruction with total-variation regularization and robust autofocusing halves the effective sensor pixel pitch and yields down to 870 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate chemically specific, label-free bioimaging on challenging specimens, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular vesicles and unstained mouse liver tissue. In liver sections, imaging at λ = 330 nm reveals lipid- and retinoid-rich accumulations that co-localize with Oil Red O staining, enabling label-free identification of hepatic stellate (Ito) cells.
