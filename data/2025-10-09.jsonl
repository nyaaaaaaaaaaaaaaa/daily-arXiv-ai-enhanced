We make two improvements compared to previous\ntensor network studies. The first improvement involves refining the initial\ntensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves\nhigher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement\nconsists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the\nconformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions,\nwhich can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group\nmethod.
