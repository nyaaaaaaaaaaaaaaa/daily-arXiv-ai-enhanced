Here, we introduce an all-dielectric cryogenic metalens integrated with a single-element SNSPD to achieve high SDE with a smaller active area. Furthermore, we leverage a bifunctional metalens to demonstrate polarization-resolved photodetection at the telecommunication wavelength theoretically. Integrating multifunctional cryogenic metaurfaces with the state-of-the-art SNSPDs may enable novel capabilities with reduced size, weight, power, cost, and cooling (SWaP-C$^{2}$) requirements."}

While single complex-frequency wave with exponentially rising waveform can be perfectly absorbed in lossless structures. Here, we propose that arbitrary waveforms can be captured without any absorption through the synthesis of complex frequencies in a lossless system. The scattering matrix zeros of the system correspond to a set of complex frequencies with exponentially rising waveforms, each of which can be virtually and perfectly absorbed. Thus, an arbitrary waveform, decomposed into these complex frequencies automatically, can be captured without any absorption. Then, in a well-designed coupled cavity system, various waveforms such as exponentially decaying, Gaussian, rectangular, and triangular profiles, are captured with high efficiency. The proposed mechanism has potential applications in enhancing light-matter interactions, optical energy storage, and photonic quantum memory."}

This theory integrates the optoelectronic imaging hardware front end and computational reconstruction back end into a unified framework. It establishes a complete spatial imaging chain information transfer model with the objective of obtaining the required effective information. The paper innovatively proposes a quantifiable Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) product criterion. It demonstrates that the system information transmission ability is determined by the product of MTF and SNR, and that these parameters can compensate for each other to achieve equivalent information transfer. Validation through a high-resolution Earth observation system case shows that under consistent reconstruction mean square error conditions, increasing time delay integration stages reduces optical aperture size and significantly lowers primary mirror mass. Simulations and physical experiments further indicate that by increasing integration time, low-resolution optical systems achieve reconstructed fidelity comparable to high-resolution systems. This verifies that small-aperture optical systems can achieve equivalent imaging performance by enhancing SNR. This theory has been successfully applied in the design of the Jilin-1 satellite constellation, providing a new paradigm for low-cost high-resolution remote sensing systems."}

As an example, for a disk-shaped phase plate, with the beam acting on the edge at a radius of 10 cm, a rotation frequency of 1 kHz, and a phase-element size of 10 nm, the continuous spectral broadening reaches 0.07%. Further increasing the rotation speed or reducing the phase-element can lead to greater spectral broadening. When multiple URPPs are arranged in series, the superimposed spatiotemporal modulation further enhances the continuous spectral broadening and achieves more effective speckle smoothing. The scheme is applicable to broadening the independent spectrum of optical frequency combs as well as to the mitigation of laser-plasma instabilities in inertial fusion energy."}

In general, at a long distance $r$ from the source, the near-surface field is mostly contributed by the geometrical optics term (describing the radiation pattern), a guided wave, and the higher-order reactive contribution referred to as the Norton wave. In the special case of a perfect magnetic conductor interface, the first two terms vanish, so the residual Norton wave determines the steepest achievable field decay profile of $~r^{-3/2}$ (for a two-dimensional horizontal magnetic dipole). In this letter, we reveal that in the presence of a nonlocal metasurface described by the second-order impedance boundary condition, the field decay can be further accelerated by suppressing the Norton wave (approaching the profiles $r^{-5/2}$ and $r^{-7/2}$ for electric and magnetic fields, respectively). In a proposed practical realization of a nonlocal metasurface, the effect is numerically verified and shown to reduce the edge diffraction effects by 10 dB for the shield diameter of only one wavelength, paving the way toward compact antenna systems."}

However, they suffer from poor light extraction efficiency, and accurate composition-specific optical data for these materials remain scarce. This study presents a DFT-FDTD framework to optimize light extraction via compositional tuning and plasmonic enhancement. First, DFT calculations were performed to obtain composition-specific complex refractive index and extinction coefficient values for $x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75$, and $1$. Results show bandgap increased from 1.331 eV for CsSnI$_3$ to 1.927 eV for CsGeI$_3$ with increasing Ge content, while refractive index ranges from 2.2 to 2.6 across compositions. These optical constants were then used as inputs for FDTD simulations of a PeLED structure with optimized Au/SiO$_2$ core-shell nanorods for plasmonic enhancement. A 12.1-fold Purcell enhancement was achieved for CsSn$_{0.25}$Ge$_{0.75}$I$_3$, while light extraction efficiency reached 25% for CsSn$_{0.5}$Ge$_{0.5}$I$_3$. LEE enhancement of 36% was obtained for CsSnI$_3$, and spectral overlap between emitter and plasmon resonance reached 96% for Sn-rich compositions. Design guidelines indicate CsSn$_{0.5}$Ge$_{0.5}$I$_3$ offers optimal balance of extraction efficiency (25%), Purcell enhancement (5.3$\\times$), spectral overlap (93%), and oxidation stability for wearable and flexible optoelectronic applications, while CsSn$_{0.25}$Ge$_{0.75}$I$_3$ is recommended for applications prioritizing spontaneous emission rate."}

Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range. This approach improves both the calibration and performance evaluation of spectrometers, and it contributes to the advancement of optical metrology."}

Achieving this control requires both enhanced local electromagnetic fields to boost emission intensity and engineered radiation patterns to direct photons efficiently. Mie voids, consisting of an air cavity surrounded by a high-index semiconductor, are particularly suited for this purpose because they expose their strongest fields in an accessible region for nearby emitters while supporting resonances that shape directional emission through interference. Here, we demonstrate an all-van der Waals nanophotonic platform that couples excitons in atomically thin WS$_2$ to Mie void resonators formed in WSe$_2$. Guided by electromagnetic simulations, we identify void geometries that maximize photoluminescence through synergistic enhancement of excitation and emission processes. We also develop a two-step fabrication strategy that enables independent control of void diameter and depth, providing a route to systematically tune the optical response. Experimentally, we observe up to a 600-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity from monolayer WS$_2$ placed on individual voids compared to on an unstructured WSe$_2$, along with pronounced out-of-plane beaming of light that yields a forward-to-off-axis enhancement of 2.6 dB. Our results establish Mie voids in van der Waals semiconductors as a new platform for controlling light-matter interactions and realizing compact, directional, and efficient nanoscale light sources."}

Here, the key challenge is to separate the small quantum vacuum signal at the oscillation frequency of the probe that is mainly emitted in the vicinity of its forward cone from the large probe background. While quantitatively accurate predictions of the associated quantum vacuum signals are available, to date there is no framework that combines these predictions with a diffractive beam propagation code. Such codes are designed to holistically model optical experiments and can reliably account for diffraction and absorption losses of optical devices, like lenses and apertures. The latter inevitably influence and modify both the induced signal and background components prior to their detection in experiment.

In a first regime, the waves undergo a slow, irreversible thermalization process, which is accurately described by the wave turbulence kinetic equation and the associated H-theorem of entropy growth. In stark contrast with this expected irreversible process, we identify a second different regime, where strong phase-correlations spontaneously emerge, giving rise to a fast reversible oscillatory dynamics of the normal correlator and anomalous phase-correlator.

However, its acquisition speed remains limited by fluorophore emission rates and photodamage. To increase the pixel rate of a two-photon microscope beyond a few megahertz (MHz), multi-point parallelized schemes have been proposed. Two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy emerges as an effective approach for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live specimens, as it enables parallelized excitation while minimizing the required laser power. However, optimizing the signal-to-photodamage ratio in 2P light-sheet microscopy requires to precisely control the illumination parameters, including both wavelength and pulse frequency. Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos. We achieve kilohertz imaging frame rate, reaching more than 150 MHz pixel rates with fluorescent signal levels above 10 $photons.pixel^{-1}$ using a laser mean power and a peak intensity in the range of 100 mW and 0.1 $TW.cm^{-2}$ at the sample, respectively.
