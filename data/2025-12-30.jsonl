Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires \"moderate\" parameter tuning."}

Hence, not only the unitarity right-hand cut but also the left-hand one continuum contributions are calculated in the finite volume. A proper extension of the standard Veltman-Pasarino identities is needed, as well as a suitable projection on the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the octahedral group, based on either a finite set of cubic harmonics or the matrices which represent the irreps properly. From the ChPT we construct the IAM in the internal space, which provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering in the finite volume. Our results for various low-energy constants sets show sizable corrections with respect to previous analyses in the literature for $ m_πL \\lesssim 2$, being compatible with energy levels lattice data.

We demonstrate that both high-index and low-index layer modulations can produce significant parametric amplification, with high-index modulation yielding higher gain for comparable modulation depths. The amplification is frequency-agile, with gain peaks tunable across a broad spectral range, and exhibits strong asymmetry between sub-Bragg and supra-Bragg regimes, the former requires substantially stronger modulation for comparable gain. In the extreme sub-Bragg limit, the system transitions from discrete sideband amplification to a broadband gain continuum at high frequencies, explained by multi-phase-matching of parametric processes.

Upon doping with organic dye molecules, the microbeads show excellent lasing characteristics with low lasing thresholds. Measurements of the mechanical properties reveal that the lasing characteristics are directly proportional to the applied external force. The measured Young's modulus confirms that the newly synthesized microlasers are very soft and can detect higher forces than previously applied deformable microlasers made from oil droplets. Furthermore, we show that elastomer microlasers are non-toxic and stable in aqueous environments, making them ideally suited for sensing forces inside tissues and small animals."}

Despite substantial improvement in peak optical patterning rates enabled by recent parallel exposure strategies, the practical fabrication rate of TPL for large structures remains low. This gap is primarily attributed to the mismatched bandwidth among toolpath generation, data transferring, and laser patterning, and the stop-and-go operation for part stitching etc. Here, we present a line-illumination temporal focusing TPL (Line-TF TPL) solution that, for the first time, demonstrates true continuous 3D nanolithography with full-bandwidth data streaming, grayscale voxel tuning, and cost-effective large-scale fabrication capability. To achieve the goal, we use a digital micromirror device (DMD) to temporally focus femtosecond laser pulses into a programmable line with enhanced 3D resolution, pixel-level grayscale control, and a high-refresh rate (>10 kHz), realizing continuous fabrication at a hardware-limited maximum rate. Specifically, we fabricated centimeter-scale 3D structures with sub-diffraction features down to 75 nm laterally and 99 nm axially. Our method eliminates stitching defects by continuous scanning and grayscale stitching; and provides real-time pattern streaming at a bandwidth that is one order of magnitude higher than previous TPL systems. The line-scanning strategy also substantially lowers the pulse-energy requirement, hence the cost for parallel TPL; and maximizes the machine uptime through continuous operation, both of which are critical metrics for industrialization. Finally, we demonstrated centimeter-scale artworks, fine 3D features, and complex miniaturized optics, revealing the Line-TF TPL's large-scale application potential in photonic packaging, metamaterial discovery, and biomedicine."}

Using this approach, the free-running RTD linewidth of 50 MHz was narrowed to 165 Hz, while the single-sideband phase noise reached -80 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz offset with a locking range of 80 MHz.

By incorporating a Mach-Zehnder interferometer into the coupling region, the device facilitates a continuous and reversible transition across the entire coupling spectrum from under-coupling and critical coupling to deep over-coupling. To ensure high spectral purity, we employ Euler bends to facilitate an adiabatic transition between the straight and curved waveguide sections. This design effectively suppresses the excitation of higher-order modes, resulting in a clean transmission spectrum characterized by exclusive fundamental mode operation. At the critical coupling point, the resonator exhibits a high extinction ratio exceeding 30 dB.

What we lack in reaching these aspirations is the resilience of such light transport to deformations of the waveguide. Although recent theoretical investigations have delineated the attributes of ideal multimode fibres capable of deformation-enduring conveyance of structured light, tangible fibres possessing this indispensable trait to a practical extent remain elusive. Our study takes a deep dive into the precision of commercially available multimode fibres with the highest probability of demonstrating the phenomenon. We identified minuscule imperfections in their refractive index distribution, examined how these affect light transport when the fibre is deformed, and studied their implications for imaging applications. Our investigation has confirmed that these imperfections are indeed responsible for the undesirable alterations introduced into the output structured light fields during bending. Finally, as an alternative to standard graded-index fibres, manufactured by drawing silica-based preforms, we present narrow multimode waveguides in which the refractive-index profile has been established by ion exchange. These waveguides indeed exhibit previously unseen resilience of structured light transport even under severe deformation conditions and aptly fulfil the requirements of imaging applications."}

By treating the measured intensity distribution as a statistical object, we define Fisher information with respect to physically relevant parameters, such as transverse displacement. We demonstrate that optical modes with comparable Shannon entropy can exhibit markedly different Fisher information, revealing sensitivity features associated with nodal structure and local curvature. Using Hermite--Gaussian modes as minimal test cases, we show that increasing modal order systematically enhances Fisher information. We then extend the analysis to two widely used families in structured light: Laguerre--Gaussian vortex beams and finite-energy Bessel--Gauss beams. Across these representative families, Fisher information provides a unified and experimentally accessible criterion for comparing structured optical fields in sensing applications."}

Machine-learning-assisted optimization pipelines have recently emerged as efficient tools to accelerate this process, yet their performance strongly depends on the choice of neural-network (NN) architecture. In this work, we integrate the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm into an established deep-learning optimization framework for dielectric chiral metasurfaces. NEAT autonomously evolves both network topology and connection weights, enabling task-specific architectures without manual tuning, whereas the reinforcement-learning strategy in our framework evolves knowledge of the solution space and fine-tunes a model's weights in parallel. Using a pipeline-produced dataset of 9,600 simulated GaP metasurface geometries, we evaluate NEAT under varying input dimensionalities, feature-scaling methods, and data sizes. With standardized feature scaling yielding the most consistent performance for both examined output dimensionalities, the relatively compact NEAT-evolved NN models, when integrated into the full optimization pipeline, achieve similar or improved predictive accuracy and generalization compared to initially employed dense few-layer perceptrons. Accordingly, these resource-efficient models successfully perform inference of metasurfaces exhibiting strong circular dichroism in the visible spectrum, allowing for transfer learning between simulated and experimental data. This approach demonstrates a scalable path toward adaptive, self-configuring machine-learning frameworks for automated photonic design both standalone and as building block for agentic artificial intelligence (AI)."}

While phase-change materials (PCMs) provide large refractive index modulation, widely used materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) have been successfully deployed in commercial applications including optical data storage. However, they exhibit significant optical absorption in their crystalline state, which poses a challenge for transmissive photonic devices such as PTIs where high transparency is essential. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by integrating the ultra-low-loss PCM antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) onto a silicon-based 2D PTI. We achieve submicron-scale selective patterning of Sb2Se3 on a photonic crystal for the first time, and demonstrate a topological phase transition induced by the material phase change. Owing to the transparency of Sb2Se3 in both its amorphous and crystalline states, a high Q-factor on the order of 10^3 is preserved-representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous GST-based devices. This work resolves the absorption-loss bottleneck in reconfigurable PTIs and paves the way for practical, low-loss, tunable topological photonic devices."}

Exact expressions for the orbital angular momentum density and the total angular momentum transmitted to the disk are obtained for both paraxial and nonparaxial regimes. By varying the beam wavelength, polarization, and cone angle, several experimentally relevant regimes of angular momentum transfer are identified. In the extreme nonparaxial regime, the absorbed angular momentum displays a staircase-like dependence on the object size, which can be interpreted as a geometric Hall-type response of the twisted field. The results suggest potential applications for controlled angular momentum transfer and size-sensitive probing of absorbing objects."}

This strategy works well for rotating-waveplate systems, where the accessible polarization states trace a curve on the Poincaré sphere and the corresponding optimization problem is generally well posed. However, it becomes degenerate for liquid-crystal-based systems, which can generate arbitrary polarization states, and whose additional degrees of freedom allow the optimization of metrics beyond the $\\ell^2$-condition number. Leveraging this unique advantage of liquid-crystal polarimeters, we introduce additional performance measures derived from alternative norms and error distributions computed via Monte Carlo simulations to inform the design of measurement schemes. We then experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness in suppressing errors, paving the way for more robust and efficient polarization measurements."}
