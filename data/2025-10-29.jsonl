Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise\nto an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron''\nbound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by\nbeing off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation\nof this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product\nstate techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to\nperform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on\nhadron formation.

These spectral\nsingularities can give rise to counterintuitive mode switching, where a mode\nwith a lower quality factor and initially smaller increase of modal gain\nreaches the lasing threshold ahead of a more favorable competitor.
