It provides direct access to the energy distribution of excited carriers and to the total energy transferred to the system. By decomposing the response into contributions from different multi-photon resonant processes, we systematically study the dependence of excited-carrier density and absorbed energy on key pump-pulse parameters: duration, amplitude, and photon energy. Our results reveal a complex interplay between these parameters, governed by resonant Rabi-like dynamics and competition between different multi-photon absorption channels.

Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing."}

The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy.

Electrically, multiple phase levels can be encoded by controlling the heater power and employing different microheater architectures to induce varying degrees of PCM amorphization. However, encoding a large number of levels is not straightforward. In this work, we first investigate a phase shifter structure based on a GeSe PCM integrated on top of a silicon-on-insulator waveguide, employing a simple rectangular-shaped heater under pulse-width modulation (PWM). We numerically demonstrate that multilevel phase shifts can be achieved because of non-uniform heating in the GeSe PCM layer. However, the resulting phase levels for this basic configuration are highly non-linear because of the uniform power dissipation along the light propagation direction characterized by the same cross-section. To overcome this limitation, we designed a novel PCM-based phase shifter with a segmented heater whose width gradually increases along the light propagation direction. This configuration enables the encoding of hundreds of well-spaced phase levels between 0 and $π$, facilitated by smoother amorphization arising from the combined effects of non-uniform heating across segments and within each segment, while achieving an insertion loss of only 0.6 dB in the worst case. Furthermore, when evaluating both heater architectures under pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) at a fixed pulse duration, we observe behavior consistent with the trends observed for PWM, confirming the superior performance of the segmented heater design."}

Guided by phase-matching profiles, we propose design strategies to improve the phase coherence, particularly by introducing a high-index waveguide layer that confines the fundamental field in the nonlinear material to regions where the harmonic Green's function varies slowly.

Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schrödinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons."}

This platform enables strong light-matter interaction through deep subwavelength confinement while remaining compatible with scalable fabrication. We show that in this regime an explicit treatment of the emitter's spatial extent is required, and that a confinement-factor approximation more accurately predicts the coupling, revealing design rules inaccessible to dipole-based metrics. For an InP/InGaAsP system, we predict coupling strengths of 0.4-0.7 meV for gap sizes of 50-10 nm, establishing the buried heterostructure-bowtie architecture as a practical route to deterministic strong coupling in solid-state nanophotonics."}

Among the many degrees of freedom of light, orbital angular momentum (OAM) further expands these capabilities by unlocking new regimes of control in information encoding, particle manipulation, and symmetry-driven selection rules. However, exploiting OAM to drive nonlinear, non-perturbative effects in solids remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regime, a key region for accessing these effects in ambient air, where spatial light modulators do not operate. Here, we circumvent this limitation by generating femtosecond, few-cycle MIR Bessel-Gauss vortex (BGV) and Perfect optical vortices (POVs), using a robust, static spatial-shaping strategy. Using those beams to drive the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in solids, we show that the resulting harmonic beams faithfully inherit the structural properties of the drivers: the constant-intensity ring of the POV is preserved across harmonic orders, while the harmonic BGVs retain their intrinsic TC-dependent profiles. Furthermore, by verifying the OAM up-scaling law, we confirm OAM conservation during HHG in solids. These results establish strong-field HHG in solids as a robust platform for synthesizing ultrafast structured harmonic light with controllable, high-value OAM."}

A recently-developed alternative is holographic endoscopy, which exploits controlled light transport through hair-thin optical fibres. With minimal invasiveness, it provides observations at comparable spatial resolution, while extending its applicability to unprecedented depths. It has been used to resolve details of sub-cellular structural connectivity, record neuronal signalling, and monitor blood flow from the deepest locations of the living brain. Yet, its use, particularly in densely labelled brain regions, has so far been constrained by significant contrast loss, primarily due to the absence of a practical mechanism for rejecting out-of-focus fluorescence light -- a capability inherently provided by confocal and multi-photon microscopy. Exploring opportunities in the structure of light modes of different MMF types we identify the possibility of achieving an analogue to confocal fluorescence microscopy through MMF-based endoscopes. Using a novel composite fibre probe that combines graded-index and step-index MMFs, we enable spatially resolved signal collection and selective rejection of out-of-focus light. This confocal filtering significantly enhances image contrast and resolution by suppressing background and off-plane signals. We demonstrate improved imaging performance on fine structural connectivity and intracellular calcium signalling in living mouse brain."}

In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction."}

In contrast to conventional two-dimensional designs, which by symmetry may support either transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) polarization, our volumetric architecture accepts both TE and TM modes simultaneously, reflecting the dimensionality and versatility required by the photonic devices. The metasurface comprises a periodic lattice of gold nanostructures embedded in a dielectric polymer matrix, creating complex metal-dielectric interfaces that sustain tightly confined plasmonic resonances. When driven by ultrafast near-infrared pulses, these resonances concentrate optical energy at the nanoscale, enabling efficient third-harmonic generation and upconversion of visible light into the ultraviolet (UV) and deep-UV regimes with enhanced conversion efficiency. We perform spatial and temporal mapping of the nonlinear response under both TE and TM excitation. Our measurements reveal polarization-agnostic field enhancement and spectral tunability arising from the three-dimensional morphology-capabilities unattainable in planar metasurfaces, where two-dimensional symmetry inherently limits polarization flexibility and functional bandwidth. This 3D platform provides a flexible design toolbox for polarization-independent UV and deep-UV light sources. Potential applications include high-resolution UV spectroscopy, optical multiplexing, data storage, and emerging quantum photonic architectures. By establishing fundamental insights into three-dimensional nonlinear metasurface behavior, our work paves the way for next-generation reconfigurable, multi-polarization nanophotonic devices."}

Recent advances in adaptive optics, wavefront shaping, and machine learning, driven by synergistic progress in fundamental theories, optoelectronic hardware, and computational algorithms, have demonstrated substantial potential in mitigating turbulence-induced distortions. Recently, active convolved illumination (ACI) was proposed as a versatile and physics-driven technique for transmitting structured light beams with minimal distortion through highly challenging turbulent regimes. While distinct in its formulation, ACI shares conceptual similarities with other physics-driven distortion correction approaches and stands to benefit from complementary integration with data-driven deep learning (DL) models. Inspired by recent work coupling deep learning with traditional turbulence mitigation strategies, the present work investigates the feasibility of integrating ACI with neural network-based methods. We outline a conceptual framework for coupling ACI with data-driven models and identify conditions under which learned representations can meaningfully support ACI's correlation-injection mechanism. As a representative example, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) together with a transfer-learning approach to examine how a learned model may operate in tandem with ACI. This exploratory study demonstrates feasible implementation pathways and establishes an early foundation for assessing the potential of future ACI-DL hybrid architectures, representing a step toward evaluating broader synergistic interactions between ACI and modern DL models."}
