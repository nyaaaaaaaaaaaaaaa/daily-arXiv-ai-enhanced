From communication to sensing, the ability to choose a pass\n\\emph{band}, rather than a single pass \\emph{frequency}, while still\nefficiently suppressing backgrounds at other frequencies, is a critical\ncapability for ensuring both detection sensitivity and power efficiency.\n  Efficient transmission of a single frequency can be achieved by a single-pole\nresonator -- which in optics is a Fabry-P\\'erot cavity offering linewidths from\nkHz to GHz and beyond. Coupling multiple resonators allows for the construction\nof flat-top multi-pole filters. These, although straightforward from RF to THz\nwhere resonators are macroscopic and tunable, are more difficult to control in\nthe optical band and typically realized with dielectric stacks, whose passband\nwidths exceed 100 GHz. Here, we bridge the gap to narrower bandwidth flat-top\nfilters by proposing and implementing a second-order Butterworth-type optical\nfilter in a single two-mirror Fabry-P\\'erot cavity, by coupling the two\npolarization modes. We demonstrate a pass-band width of 2.68(1)~GHz, a maximum\nstopband suppression of 43~dB, and a passband insertion loss of 2.2(1)~dB, with\nout-of-band power suppression falling as the fourth power of detuning. This\napproach is viable down to much narrower filters, and has the potential to\nimprove high-frequency phase noise performance of lasers, enhance the\nsensitivity of LIDARs, and provide higher quality narrowband filtering, for\nexample, for Raman spectroscopy."}
