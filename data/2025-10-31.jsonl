This study addresses the\ncritical challenge of preserving the intrinsic optical characteristics of 2D\nTMDCs during FIB patterning. We demonstrate that conventional dielectric\nencapsulation fails to protect 2D TMDCs from gallium ion-induced damage,\nleading to persistent defects and quenched optical responses in patterned\nmicrostructures.

This requires solving the Dirac equation\nrepeatedly, which is computationally demanding. The distillation method\naddresses this difficulty by using the lowest eigenvectors of the spatial\nLaplacian to construct a subspace in which the Dirac operator can be fully\ninverted. This approach is efficient for nonlocal operators such as meson-meson\nand baryon-baryon operators. However, local multiquark operators with four or\nmore (anti)quarks are computationally expensive in this framework: the cost of\ncontractions scales with a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors.\nWe present a position-space sampling method within distillation that reduces\nthis cost scaling by performing the momentum projection only over sparse grids\nrather than the full spatial lattice. We demonstrate the efficiency of this\nunbiased estimator for single-meson, single-baryon and local tetraquark\noperators. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point,\nwe apply this method to study the importance of local tetraquark operators for\nthe finite-volume $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum. To this end, we extend a large\nbasis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators by including local\ntetraquark operators.
