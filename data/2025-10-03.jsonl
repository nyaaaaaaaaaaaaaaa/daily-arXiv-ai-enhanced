Following high quality solution phase\nsynthesis of colloidal CQD (CCQD) in 1993, optical gain was first demonstrated\nin 2000 via stimulated emission (SE) measurements. Decades of phenomenology\nhave given rise to a Standard Model of optical gain in CCQD based upon two\nassumptions: a biexciton is required to achieve optical gain, and short\nbiexciton lifetimes limit the efficient development of amplified spontaneous\nemission (ASE). The Standard Model predicts the solution to efficient ASE is\nslowing Auger recombination, a task which now consumes the CCQD field. Here, we\nshow that the Standard Model is physically incorrect, leading to misdirected\nmaterials development. Inspection of the phenomenology reveals a Simple Model\nwhich uniquely reproduces all observed phenomena.

The method involves solving Maxwell's equations\nfor a large number of coupled electromagnetic plane-waves inside the dielectric\nslab, then matching the boundary conditions at the interface between the\nincidence medium and the slab, as well as those at the interface between the\nslab and the transmittance medium. In this way, one obtains the E-field and\nH-field amplitudes for all the reflected and transmitted plane-waves (i.e.,\ndiffraction orders as well as evanescent waves) that emerge within the\nincidence and transmittance media. If the refractive index (or dielectric\ntensor) of the holographic slab happens to vary in the thickness direction, one\ntreats the slab as a number of thin layers stacked upon each other, then\ncomputes and combines the scattering matrices of these layers to arrive at the\ncomplete solution for the entire stack. The goal of the present paper is to\nextend the standard RCWA method to the case where the hologram's dielectric\ntensor varies in the thickness direction (in addition to being periodically\nmodulated along an in-plane axis), without slicing up the thick hologram into a\nnumber of thin layers.

This quest is\nhampered by inevitable narrowing of the resonant linewidth as the cavity\nfinesse is increased, which necessitates striking a compromise between the\nmagnitude of the field enhancement and the bandwidth over which it is\nharnessed. This difficulty is exacerbated for broadband entangled-photon pairs,\nwhich are typically frequency-anticorrelated, so that the two photons cannot be\nsimultaneously admitted to a cavity except when the degenerate wavelength\ncoincides with a cavity resonance. Here we show that introducing judicious\nangular dispersion into single-photon and entangled-photon states before\nincidence on a planar Fabry-P{\\'e}rot (FP) cavity renders these non-classical\nfields omni-resonant: the entire spectrum is coupled to a single longitudinal\ncavity mode.

In general,\npre-conditioning the optical field by introducing angular dispersion enables\ncoupling non-classical states of light to a single longitudinal cavity mode,\neven if the field bandwidth far exceeds the resonant linewidth, or even exceeds\nthe cavity free-spectral-range.
