In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also\nbe used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum\n(both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to\nmatter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular\nmomentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light\nfields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as\noptical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field\nof optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction\nprocess across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by\nthe presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found\na myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation\nto microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among\nothers. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices\nand discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has\nbeen exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes.

These patterns not only degrade image quality but also decorrelate\nrapidly, limiting the effectiveness of conventional approaches, such as those\nbased on transmission matrix measurements. Here, we introduce an imaging\napproach based on second-order correlations and synthetic wavelength holography\n(SWH) to enable robust image reconstruction through thick and dynamic\nscattering media. By exploiting intensity speckle correlations and using\nshort-exposure intensity images, our method computationally reconstructs images\nfrom a hologram without requiring phase stability or static speckles, making it\ninherently resilient to phase noise. Experimental results demonstrate\nhigh-resolution imaging in both static and dynamic scattering scenarios,\noffering a promising solution for biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and\nreal-time imaging in complex environments."}

However,\nconventional QPI techniques typically rely on multi-frame acquisition or\ncomplex interferometric optics. In this work, we introduce Quad-Pixel Phase\nGradient Imaging ($QP^{2}GI$), a single-shot quantitative phase imaging method\nbased on a commercial quad-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF) sensor, where\neach microlens on the sensor covers a $2\\times2$ pixel group. The phase\ngradients of the sample induce focal spot displacements under each microlens,\nwhich lead to intensity imbalances among the four pixels. By deriving the phase\ngradients of the sample from these imbalances, $QP^{2}GI$ reconstructs\nquantitative phase maps of the sample from a single exposure. We establish a\nlight-propagation model to describe this process and evaluate its performance\nin a customized microscopic system. Experiments demonstrate that quantitative\nphase maps of microbeads and biological specimens can be reconstructed from a\nsingle acquisition, while low-coherence illumination improves robustness by\nsuppressing coherence-related noise. These results reveal the potential of\nquad-pixel PDAF sensors as cost-effective platforms for single-frame QPI."}
