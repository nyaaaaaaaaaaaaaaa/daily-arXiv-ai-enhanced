Turbulence\ninduces tip/tilt aberrations and lateral displacement, which significantly\ndegrade system performance. Existing analytical models describe the\ntransformation from an input Gaussian mode to an output OAM spectrum; however,\nour feed forward neural network model generalizes this approach by accounting\nfor the effects of these aberrations on arbitrary input OAM modes. We validate\nthe model experimentally by estimating turbulence-induced tilt and lateral\ndisplacement using a dual-camera setup and comparing the estimated spectrum\nwith the actual modal decomposition. With a typical root mean square error of\nless than 11%, our results indicate that the model could serve as a reliable\nsource of meta-information for digital signal processing, soft-decision forward\nerror correction or perhaps dynamic mode hopping in future systems."}

A range of\nexperimental dark-field techniques and retrieval algorithms have been recently\ndeveloped to extract this signal by directly resolving dark-field-associated\nlocal image blurring with a high-resolution camera. While the underlying\nphysical mechanism that generates dark-field contrast is generally defined\nsimilarly across the methods, no comparison of these dark-field techniques\nusing identical samples has been conducted. In this paper, dark-field imaging\ndata from two samples were acquired using three emerging dark-field setups at a\nsynchrotron: propagation-based, single-grid, and speckle-based X-ray imaging.\nDark-field images were then reconstructed using a variety of retrieval\nalgorithms--some requiring only a single sample exposure, others multiple; some\nperforming local, pixel-wise analysis, and others operating globally on entire\nimages. We find that the dominant contribution to dark-field contrast--arising\nfrom diffuse scattering from unresolved microstructures or multiple refractions\nthrough larger, potentially resolved structures--is consistently recovered\nacross all approaches, demonstrating mutual agreement. However, some\ndifferences emerge for structures that are spatially varying.

Conventional electronic RT-SS\nsolutions face critical challenges in operating across the millimeter-wave and\nsub-terahertz bands, which are essential spectra for 6G wireless. While\nphotonic RT-SS has the potential to surpass this limitation, the current\nimplementations feature limited bandwidths below 50 GHz and mostly rely on\nbulky dispersive fibers with high latency. Here, we address these challenges by\ndeveloping an integrated photonic RT-SS system capable of ultrabroadband\nmeasurement from microwave to sub-terahertz bands, covering the full spectrum\nfor 6G wireless. The photonic RT-SS circuit integrates a broadband\nelectro-optic (EO) modulator for unknown signal loading, an EO tunable\nmicroring filter bank for high-speed parallel frequency-to-time mapping, as\nwell as an EO comb for precise channel frequency referencing, all realized on a\nsingle thin-film lithium niobate chip.

The analysis\nmeticulously resolves limiting disorder regimes: for coarse disorder, an ideal\nOAM spectrum, sharply peaked at its nominal OAM mode, is demonstrated.\nConversely, for fine disorder, a specific fraction of total power exponentially\ndecays with disorder variance into the nominal OAM mode, with remaining power\ndistributed among nearby OAM modes, exhibiting an effective width inversely\nproportional to the dimensionless correlation length.
