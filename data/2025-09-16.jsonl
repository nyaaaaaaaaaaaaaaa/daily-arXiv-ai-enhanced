However, incomplete capture and reversal of\nscattered waves often limits pulse recompression. We address this challenge for\nspatially extended sources by introducing a generalized time-reversal\nframework, which identifies the optimal source pattern as the one that\nmaximizes the energy of the waves that are captured and reversed. In a\ntwo-dimensional diffusive waveguide, we reconstruct the time-reversed wavefront\ncorresponding to this optimal source using spatiospectral shaping, leading to a\n35-fold enhancement in peak transmitted power compared to an unmodulated pulse.\nInternal spatiotemporal measurements reveal a ``loading and firing\" process, in\nwhich energy accumulates within the medium and then is released abruptly.\nMoreover, time-reversing this burst enables deep energy delivery into the\nscattering medium. Generalized time-reversal opens new possibilities for\nshort-pulse control in strongly-scattering media, with applications ranging\nfrom optogenetics to random laser amplification."}

With the gradient\nflow we now have a technique to address the problem from first principles. The\nprimary focus is on the running coupling $\\alpha_S(\\mu)$, from which\nconfinement can be concluded alone. A central point is that the gluon\ncondensate is scale invariant, which reflects its self-similar behavior across\ndifferent scales.

We investigate a subset of the available filter functions,\ndemonstrating that a N = 4 input triangular mesh with M = 3 layers may be\noperated via self-configuration algorithms to filter M arbitrary wavelengths\nfrom a given input spectrum. The tunable nature of the architecture enables\npreconfigured filter functions to be swept in the spectral domain continuously\nover the free spectral range of the device. This removes any strict\nrequirements between the design parameters of the architecture and the center\nwavelength of a desired filter function. With this architecture, we\nexperimentally demonstrate arbitrary wavelength rejection filters with\ncontrasts as deep as 40 dB. Further, by intentionally selecting the center\nwavelengths of each filter function to lie along a wavelength grid we\ndemonstrate deep wavelength division demultiplexing (DWDM) with inter-channel\ncrosstalk between -25 dB and -40 dB. Unlike typical DWDM systems, in this\narchitecture the center wavelength of each channel is not fixed at fabrication\nand instead may be swept or reordered arbitrarily. This device demonstrates\nadvantages over typical methods for DWDM, Raman spectroscopy, and correlation\nspectroscopy as well as other applications."}

In their focal region, the intensity\npattern outlines a spiral of decreasing radius and pitch. We examine the\npropagation dynamics of such novel waves and reveal the key factors that lead\nto angular acceleration. Moreover, we propose a two-color scheme that makes it\npossible to generate dynamically twisting light, an optical analog of a drill,\nthat can rotate at THz frequencies."}
