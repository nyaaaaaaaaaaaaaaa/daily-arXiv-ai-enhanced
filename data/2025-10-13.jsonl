The energy\nbands thus become a Riemann surface, and such an energy-band Riemann surface\nunderlies all the important signatures of non-Hermitian topological physics\nphenomena. Despite a long history and recent theoretical interests, the\nenergy-band Riemann surface has not been experimentally studied.

In the case of a crystal coating supermirror,\nthe excess loss has been suggested to depend on polarization. On the other\nhand, an amorphous coating supermirror was expected to have a negligible\npolarization dependence. In this work, we measured the excess loss as a\nfunction of mirror rotation around its optical axis in the optical region at\n681.2 nm for the three amorphous coating supermirrors produced simultaneously\nby vapor deposition in the same furnace. The back mirror of the cavity was\nrotated, and the ringdown time as a function of rotational angle was measured\nevery 10 degrees. As a result, sinusoidal variations in excess loss were\nobserved depending on the rotation. The difference in excess loss between the\nbest and worst rotational angles during the rotation of the back mirror reached\na maximum of 5.8 +- 1.2 ppm.

In\nparticular, the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase has enabled optical metasurfaces\nwith broad applications. However, the PB phase is based on polarization\nevolution in a two-dimensional space, which fails to account for other\npolarization degrees of freedom. Here, we generalize the concept of geometric\nphase to a four-dimensional (4D) Riemann-Silberstein (RS) space that\ncharacterizes the complete electromagnetic polarization, including electric,\nmagnetic, and hybrid polarizations. We show that the 4D polarization evolution\nin the RS space can give rise to a new geometric phase-the RS phase-in addition\nto the PB phase. The PB phase depends on optical spin and usually manifests in\ncircularly polarized light, whereas the RS phase depends on optical linear\nmomentum and can manifest in arbitrarily polarized light. Their synergy\nprovides a unified geometric framework for light propagation at interfaces and\nenables unprecedented high-dimensional light control. As a proof of principle,\nwe propose and demonstrate RS metasurfaces capable of multiplexed wavefront\nshaping, which can reconfigure up to twelve distinct outputs via switching\nincident 4D polarization.

An emerging challenge\nfocuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and\nhybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong\ncoupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the\ninterplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been\nobserved to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally\ndemonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected\nquasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show (1) the emergence of\nanticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression\nof reflection, observed under TE-polarized excitation, and (2) the\nmanifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarized illumination as a result\nof energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak\ncoupling regime. Both effects are accompanied by hybridized near-fields of the\nmodes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the\nangle of incidence, polarization, and surrounding environment.

Adopting the\ncondensed-matter framework, a spatial period defines an effective Brillouin\nzone, and polarization eigenstates can be grouped in two bands, with the role\nof energy played by the opposite phase delay.
