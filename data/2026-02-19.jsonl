Here, we present Chem-SIM, a structured-illumination fluorescence detected mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, for super-resolution chemical imaging of microorganisms and mammalian cells. A computational pipeline combining Poisson maximum-likelihood demodulation and spectral normalization across wavenumber is implemented to robustly recover the weak IR-induced fluorescence intensity change under low photon budgets and convert the fluorescence intensity modulation to chemical fingerprints. A photothermal gating scheme further rejects water backgrounds in aqueous samples, while the IR pump maintains cellular activity at near-physiological temperature. Chem-SIM preserves full vibrational fingerprints, achieves SIM-grade lateral resolution, and operates in a high-throughput, camera-based format with minimal modifications and low photothermal load. At the single-bacterium level, Chem-SIM distinguishes stationary phase from log phase cells through chemical content mapping. In ovarian cancer cells, Chem-SIM delivers readouts of lipid chemistry under deuterium fatty acid treatment and resolves lipid droplets dynamics in live cells. Together, Chem-SIM provides an accessible route to super-resolved mapping of organelle chemistry, metabolism, and dynamics."}

Previously, FT solitons were studied only in the case of the second-order dispersion ($m=2$). Following the recent observation of pure-quartic solitons (corresponding to $m=4$), we here construct families of FT solitons in the setting with pure-high-even-order dispersion (PHEOD), including $m=4,6,8$, and $10$, and address interactions between them. The PHEOD solitons are completely stable, and, unlike the conventional solitons, they feature oscillatory tails. Interactions between the PHEOD solitons are anomalous, featuring repulsion and attraction between in- and out-of-phase solitons, respectively. These results expand the variety of optical solitons maintained by diverse dispersive nonlinear media."}

However, these two material properties are intrinsically linked through the empirical Moss rule, which states that the refractive index of a dielectric decreases as its band gap energy increases. Materials that surpass this rule, termed super-Mossian dielectrics, combine large refractive indices with wide optical transparency and are therefore ideal candidates for advanced photonic applications. This Review surveys the expanding landscape of high-index dielectric and semiconductor materials, with a particular focus on those that surpass the Moss rule. We discuss how electronic band structures with a large joint density of states near the band edge give rise to super-Mossian behavior and how first-principles computational screening can accelerate their discovery. Finally, we establish how the refractive index sets the performance limits of nanoresonators, waveguides, and metasurfaces, highlighting super-Mossian dielectrics as a promising route toward the next performance leap in photonic technologies."}

Here, we realize a birefringence-driven anisotropic optical cavity using $α$-MoO3 flakes, capitalizing on their ultralow optical loss and pronounced in-plane birefringence. Using angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, we observe a mode-sensitive enhancement of anisotropy, dependent on both flake thickness and Raman shift. A unified model that incorporates the intrinsic Raman tensor, birefringence, and chromatic dispersion accurately reproduces the experimental data, elucidating how cavity resonances at both excitation and scattered wavelengths interact. Within this framework, the intrinsic phonon anisotropy is quantified, providing invaluable insights for accurately predicting ARPR responses and identifying crystallographic orientation. This work provides fundamental insights into birefringence-governed cavities and opens avenues for high-performance birefringent optics and cavity-enhanced anisotropic phenomena."}

Their performance relies on ultra-stable, narrow-linewidth lasers, frequency stabilized to a compact portable optical cavity. Among various designs, the cubic spacer-based ultra-stable cavity is particularly well-suited for transportable applications due to its low sensitivity to vibrations, owing to its symmetric geometry and robust mounting structure. While longer cavities offer a lower fundamental thermal noise floor, one needs to strike a balance between transportability and size. In this aspect, the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity offers a lower fundamental thermal noise floor in comparison to smaller counterparts, while still retaining a reasonable SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) for terrestrial and aerial PNT applications. Its dual-axis design also enables multi-wavelength laser stabilization, making it a promising candidate for future transportable clock applications. This work presents a detailed study of the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity using FEM (Finite Element Method) to evaluate its mechanical and thermal stability. We analyze the impact of various geometric factors, mounting forces, and machining imperfections, while also modelling thermal effects such as conduction, radiation, and mirror heating within a vacuum chamber and thermally shielded environment. Our findings provide design insights for developing robust dual-axis optical reference cavities, advancing the deployment of portable atomic clocks for next-generation applications in PNT, geodesy, VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) and deep space missions."}

However, the range of system functions accessible critically depends on the extent to which free-space and fiber components can be made integrable. The ultralow-expansion cavity-stabilized laser$-$often used in precision metrology, high-resolution sensors, and advanced systems in atomic physics$-$is one component that currently has no direct parallel on chip. Lasers stabilized to photonically-integrated resonators exist, but exhibit considerably higher frequency noise and are accompanied by large levels of frequency drift. We demonstrate here a new architecture for an ultranarrow linewidth integrated laser based on stabilization to a sinusoidal fringe of an interferometer having a long 25-m unbalanced delay line. Our interferometric laser not only advances the state-of-the-art for on-chip lasers, but we in addition introduce an amplitude locking scheme that greatly suppresses the laser's long-term frequency wander. We achieve a record on-chip fractional frequency noise of $5.6 \\times 10^{-14}$, corresponding to a linewidth of 12 Hz centered at 1348 nm. To showcase the utility of this laser, we divide the optical carrier to microwave frequencies, demonstrating the ability to outperform state-of-the-art quartz crystal oscillators by 15 dB or more."}

Supplementary: 10 pages, 8 figures, 1 table", "summary": "Free-space optical communications with moving targets, such as satellite terminals, demand ultrafast wavefront sensing and correction. This is typically addressed using a Shack-Hartmann sensor, which pairs a high-speed camera with a lenslet array, but such systems add significant cost, weight, and power demands. In this work, we present a hybrid opto-electric neural network (OENN) wavefront sensor that enables ultra-high-speed operation in a compact, low-cost system. Subwavelength diffractive metasurfaces efficiently encode the incoming wavefront into tailored irradiance patterns, which are then decoded by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). In simulation and experiment, the hybrid approach achieves average Strehl ratio (SR) improvements exceeding 60% and 45%, respectively, for unseen wavefronts compared to purely electronic sensors with few-pixel inputs. Although larger MLPs allow purely electronic sensors to match the hybrid's SR under static conditions, transient atmosphere modeling shows that their added latency leads to rapid SR degradation with increasing Greenwood frequency, while the hybrid system maintains performance. These results highlight the potential of hybrid OENN architectures to unlock scalable, high-bandwidth free-space communication systems and, more broadly, to advance optical technologies where real-time sensing is constrained by electronic latency."}

The suspended actuator exploits PZT's strong piezoelectric effect to induce mechanically driven phase shifts, enabling efficient modulation in a Mach--Zehnder interferometer.

The method unifies and extends the Helmholtz Gauss families and readily generalizes to nonseparable nondiffracting architectures. Experiments on superposed Bessel Gauss beams confirm the predicted transverse rotations, demonstrating that this operator approach is a fast, transparent, and practical alternative to standard diffraction ntegral treatments"}
