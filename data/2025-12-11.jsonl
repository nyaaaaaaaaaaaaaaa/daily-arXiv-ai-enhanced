Proceeding of Quark matter 2025", "summary": "Finite density lattice QCD usually relies on extrapolations in baryon chemical potential ($μ_B$), be it Taylor expansion, T' expansion (\\cite{Borsanyi:2021sxv}) or analytical continuation. However, their range of validity is difficult to control. In the canonical formulation, the baryon density is the parameter of the system, not $μ_B$. Here we demonstrate that we can access finite density QCD in the canonical formulation with physical quark masses. We present first results with both the strangeness ($n_S$) and baryon ($n_B$) densities as parameters. Specifically, we compute the QCD pressure and chemical potentials as functions of $n_B$ and $n_S$. Our computations rely on high-statistics simulations with 2+1 4HEX-staggered fermions."}

However, as the number of comb modes is very large and the optical energy is dispersed over them, the optical energy per each comb mode is ultrasmall, limiting the sensitivity of highly sensitive spectroscopy. If we can concentrate the optical energy into the comb modes that only overlap with the absorption spectra, we can demonstrate drastic improvements in its measurement sensitivity. In this study, we developed a freely controllable optical frequency comb source based on the spectral peak phenomenon. The comb modes overlapping the CH4 absorption spectra were transformed into background-suppressed spectral peaks at the nonlinear loop mirror using a CH4 gas cell. Coherence-preserving power scaling of the generated comb was demonstrated using a fiber Raman amplifier. Subsequently, only the single-comb mode was filtered using a newly developed spectral filter with an ultrahigh resolution. The maximum optical power of a single comb was estimated to be more than 10 mW. The ring-down decay signal from the high-finesse optical cavity was measured using a single selected mode of the generated controllable comb. As a demonstration, the 2v_3 bands of the CH4 absorption spectra were accurately measured by comb-mode-resolved, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) with high sensitivity up to 4.2 x 10^(-11) cm^(-1). This sensitivity is two orders of magnitude higher than that of previously reported comb-based CRDS. The residual was only 0.29 %, indicating the high accuracy of the proposed spectrometer for molecular spectral analysis. This approach can be extended to other wavelength ranges and is useful for highly sensitive, high-resolution, comb-resolved spectroscopy."}

We demonstrate that the highly disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer inherently facilitates mechanical cleavage down to few-nanometer thicknesses (about 4 nm).

The device realizes a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele model, featuring alternating coupling strengths and imaginary on-site detunings. This configuration supports a symmetry-protected zero mode stabilized by non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry, which enforces a uniform $π/2$ phase shift between adjacent nanolasers, establishing a coherent phase winding around the array. By adjusting the gain/loss contrast in a parity-time (PT)-like pumping scheme, the system can be tuned to a chiral exceptional point, where energy flows unidirectionally between nanocavities despite their reciprocal coupling. This symmetry-enforced, directional tunneling leads to far-field emission carrying non-zero OAM, providing a direct signature of the phase-structured lasing mode. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable strategy for engineering compact, phase-locked laser arrays with controllable angular momentum output, and open new avenues for structured light generation in integrated photonic platforms."}

The analytical model investigates two representative coupling scenarios,including Gaussian beam and plane wave excitation. The PIB-computed coefficient η enhancements agree well with the experimental values, especially for the multiple-mode fibers under large-angle illuminations. Using PIB to optimize the beam-fiber parameters, we show that at the incidence angle of 37 degree, η could increase from 0.3320 to 0.5102 by the identical ring gratings.

WSM NP with inherent nonreciprocity has a radiative heat flux 27 times higher than NP with degenerate modes. The underlying physics is elucidated by the coupling and decoupling of the electromagnetic local density of states between nonreciprocal WSN NP and the plate in the near-field.

While Brillouin lasers routinely achieve sub-Hz instantaneous linewidths, many of these applications also require exceptional frequency stability and high-power single-mode emission. A recent demonstration showed that extending the resonator length increases the laser power while also improving the frequency stability through suppression of thermorefractive noise. However, as the resonator scales to larger lengths, multiple optical resonances can be found within the Brillouin gain bandwidth, greatly complicating the laser dynamics compared to existing coupled-mode Brillouin laser models. Given the potential to scale lasers of this type to watt-level output powers at sub-mHz linewidths, a theoretical model describing this physics is needed to provide key insights into their performance. Here, we develop a coupled-mode theory of integrated large mode volume Brillouin lasers, accounting for multiple cavity modes with potential to lase within the gain bandwidth. We obtain expressions for the steady-state dynamics, spontaneous spectrum, relative intensity noise, and frequency noise. Our analysis reveals that the broad gain bandwidth results in atypical Brillouin dynamics, giving rise to distinct features in the noise spectra, and consequently modifications of the standard, single-mode fundamental linewidth of Brillouin lasers. Additionally, these features may be used for a variety of tangential applications, such as phonon spectroscopy or quality factor enhancement. Furthermore, we find that the linewidth can be significantly impacted by transferred RIN from the external pump in Brillouin lasers that lack ideal phase matching."}
