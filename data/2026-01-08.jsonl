A generalized method for achieving this control involves manipulating the photoemission laser's temporal distribution at the picosecond level, a long-standing technical challenge. Recent developments in laser shaping have enabled the creation of high-power, picosecond-scale symmetrical and asymmetrical temporal profiles, capable of fine-tuning complex space-charge dynamics and external field effects in relativistic charged-particle beams. Here, we demonstrate that rather than deviations from theorized, idealized laser distributions, a controlled asymmetry can be harnessed to counteract accelerator-induced distortions. By implementing spatiotemporal shaping of the ultraviolet photocathode laser at the LCLS-II superconducting injector, we achieve deterministic control over the longitudinal phase space without downstream corrections. We find that this optical asymmetry induces a self-linearizing effect across both low (40 pC) and high (80 pC) charge regimes, effectively suppressing nonlinear compression and energy chirp. Consequently, this approach is expected to preserve a low emittance comparable to that of ideal flattop or regular Gaussian profiles, while delivering superior current uniformity and shot-to-shot stability. These results establish spatiotemporal laser shaping as a compact, generalizable tool for directly optimizing beam brightness at the source."}

Self-homodyne coherent (SHC) transmission is a promising architecture because it preserves the spectral efficiency of coherent detection while greatly simplifying digital signal processing, but its practical deployment is critically limited by random and often ultrafast state-of-polarization (SOP) fluctuations that induce carrier fading and destabilize coherent reception. Here we report the first integrated polarization controller based on thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT), enabling reset-free polarization tracking at Mrad/s speeds. The four-stage electro-optic device exhibits polarization-dependent loss (PDL) below 0.3 dB, a half-wave voltage below 2.5 V, high modulation bandwidth, and negligible DC drift. To accommodate the finite tuning range of integrated phase shifters, we develop a finite-boundary gradient-descent (FBGD) control algorithm that ensures reset-free SOP evolution with no phase jump. The implemented adaptive polarization controller (APC) is validated through both standalone polarization-tracking measurements and a dual-polarization 16-QAM SHC 400-Gbps transmission system. Transient polarization disturbances can be tracked at speeds up to 2 Mrad/s, while stable reset-free operation under continuous polarization disturbances is maintained up to 1 Mrad/s. This reset-free performance represents more than doubling the state of the art, while the pre-FEC bit-error rates remain below the HD-FEC threshold under realistic DCI conditions and lightning-scale polarization disturbances. These results establish TFLT as a new platform for ultrafast, low-power, reset-free, and drift-free polarization control in coherent optical interconnects and beyond."}

They have found numerous technological and scientific applications in telecommunications, medicine, material science, photonics and quantum optics. The electromagnetic field Green function is the central object in investigations of different types of radiation processes in those structures. In this paper, we review and further develop the recurrence procedure for evaluating the electromagnetic field Green function in a medium made of any number of homogeneous cylindrical layers. The general results are specified for a cylindrical waveguide immersed in a homogeneous medium. Expressions are provided for all the components of the Green tensor in both regions inside and outside the cylinder. As an application of the results for the Green function, we consider the radiation of a charged particle rotating around a dielectric cylinder. The intensities for all types of radiation processes are discussed. They include the synchrotron-Cherenkov radiation at large distances from the cylinder and the radiation on guided and surface polaritonic modes confined inside or near the surface of the cylinder. The paper provides explicit formulas for the electromagnetic fields and the spectral-angular densities of those radiations. It also includes a numerical and comparative analysis."}

However, to date, plasmonic applications have been limited mainly to the visible and near-infrared range, as materials supporting ultraviolet resonances typically exhibit poor chemical stability and lack robust surface functionalisation methods. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a fully programmable approach to UV plasmonics based on rhodium nanocube dimers assembled using DNA origami templates. We have developed a reliable ligand exchange strategy that allows the functionalisation of rhodium nanocubes with DNA while maintaining their colloidal stability. These DNA-modified nanocubes act as modular building blocks that can be assembled into dimers with 69% efficiency and an average gap size of 10 nm. The DNA origami design also allows for the deterministic placement of a single streptavidin protein in the plasmonic gap, unlike previous methods based on stochastic diffusion. Experiments with single-molecule autofluorescence in UV, supported by numerical simulations, show an increase in brightness of up to 22, a reduction in fluorescence lifetime, and a more than tenfold increase in the total number of detected photons. By creating a robust and versatile platform for the production of UV-resonant plasmonic nanoantennas, this work extends the functionality of plasmonics to the deep UV spectrum and opens up new possibilities for labelling-free single-protein spectroscopy."}

By treating these as tunable parameters, we explore how key properties of the theory, such as confinement and topological order, emerge in different regimes. Employing a variational mean-field analysis that interpolates between the strong- and weak-coupling regimes, we determine the large-$N$ phase structure in terms of the 't Hooft coupling $λ_\\mathrm{tH}=g^2N$ and the ratio $k/N$. We find that the topologically ordered phase remains robust at large $N$ under appropriate scalings of these parameters. This result indicates that the continuum limit of large-$N$ gauge theory may be more intricate than naively expected, and motivates studies beyond the mean-field theory, both to achieve a further understanding of confinement in gauge theories and to guide quantum simulations of large-$N$ gauge theories."}

Time-averaged interferometry (TAI) encodes spatial information about MEMS or MOEMS vibration amplitude in the interferogram's amplitude modulation using Bessel function (besselogram). Classical approaches for interferogram analysis are specialized for cosine function fringe patterns and therefore introduce reconstruction errors for besselogram decoding. This paper presents the DeepBessel: a deep learning-based approach for single-shot TAI interferogram analysis. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using synthetic data, where the input consisted of besselograms, and the output corresponded to the underlying vibration amplitude distribution. Numerical validation and experimental testing demonstrated that DeepBessel significantly reduces reconstruction errors compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, e.g., Hilbert Spiral Transform (HST) method. The proposed network effectively mitigates errors caused by the mismatch between the Bessel and cosine functions. The results indicate that deep learning can improve the accuracy of full-field vibration measurements, offering new possibilities for optical metrology in MEMS or MOEMS applications."}

Silicon nitride is widely accessible and low loss into the visible, but most demonstrations rely on telecom pumping and thick stress-managed films, where the large spectral gap to the visible dispersive wave raises the soliton order and power required for efficient conversion. Here we show that pumping closer to the visible provides a complementary route. Starting from crack-free 400 nm SiN films, we implement dispersion-engineering with air-clad nanophotonic waveguides whose enhanced geometric dispersion opens an anomalous-dispersion window across the Ti-sapphire tuning range. Femtosecond Ti-sapphire pulses then drive octave-spanning combs from the visible to the near-infrared, with the visible edge and overall bandwidth lithographically tuned by the waveguide width at pulse energies of only tens of picojoules. The air-clad geometry also produces strong polarization-dependent dispersion, enabling switching between all-normal and soliton-dominated broadening in the same device, and support octave-spanning combs at 1 GHz repetition rates directly driven by a compact diode-pumped Ti-sapphire oscillator. These results position air-clad SiN nanophotonic waveguides as an efficient interface between emerging short-wavelength integrated gain platforms and fully integrated visible frequency-comb engines."}
