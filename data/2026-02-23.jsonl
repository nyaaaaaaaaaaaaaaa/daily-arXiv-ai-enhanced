First, we derive the quantization conditions in a non-relativistic framework up to total angular momentum $J=11/2$ in both cubic and elongated geometries, and for both rest and moving frames. Then, we introduce a method to transparently cross-check their convergence, using both quantized energy levels in the box and infinite-volume phase shifts for the same potential. We clarify how to incorporate spin-orbit coupling into the formalism and show in detail how the quantization conditions converge order by order in the various irreducible representations. In all, we validated 19 quantization conditions (12 in cubic box, 7 in elongated box). This is a necessary step in applying the method in precision studies of systems in finite volume with half-integer spin, such as meson-baryon scattering."}

This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics."}

At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model."}

The recent extension of these material systems into dynamic regime, where topological properties can be actively manipulated at ultrafast timescales, promises unprecedented control over topological states and their functionalities. However, translating the static topological lasing signals into high-performance logic functions remain highly challenging, which imposes a far more stringent set of materials attributes. Here, leveraging the strong nonlinearity and pronounced spectral isolation of perovskite exciton-polaritons embedded in a Dirac vortex microcavity, we experimentally demonstrate the dynamic topological Majorana-like state polariton condensation with its ultrafast logic operations at room temperature. By actively coordinating pump and control beams in both spectral and temporal domain, we dynamically steer the topological polariton condensation process and demonstrate AND and NOT logic operations, achieving record extinction ratio (~20 dB), extremely low control fluence (~0.2 nJ/cm2) and sub-picosecond response time (~500 fs). Our results expand the frontier of dynamic topology and establish a novel pathway towards robust, ultrafast, and reconfigurable on-chip polaritonic logic circuits."}

Compared with purely digital approaches, such optical encoders offer parallel and energy-efficient compression, enabling early data reduction prior to electronic processing and transmission, which is particularly attractive for resource-constrained and compact imaging systems. Although the operations realizable by a single passive optical layer remain fundamentally constrained, we systematically study several PSF encoding strategies combined with a total-variation (TV) digital reconstruction backend. Specifically, under identical compression ratios, we compare spatial binning, multi-channel random, and multi-channel orthogonal PSF based designs. Our results show that, at the same compression ratios, spatial binning achieves the highest reconstruction quality among all encoding strategies; however, it exhibits limited robustness to noise compared with multi-channel methods."}

This preference stems from various factors, including the perception that QNM theory is still developing or requires advanced mathematical tools from complex analysis. In this work, we combine numerical techniques with accurate ap-proximations to simplify the computation of QNMs and enable ultrafast reconstructions us-ing QNM expansions.

While numerous optimization algorithms exist, previous global approaches exhibit slow convergence and conversely local search strategies frequently become trapped in local optima. To address the limitations inherent to both local and global approaches, we introduce BONNI: Bayesian optimization through neural network ensemble surrogates with interior point optimization. It augments global optimization with an efficient incorporation of gradient information to determine optimal sampling points. This capability allows BONNI to circumvent the local optima found in many nanophotonic applications, while capitalizing on the efficiency of gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate BONNI's capabilities in the design of a distributed Bragg reflector as well as a dual-layer grating coupler through an exhaustive comparison against other optimization algorithms commonly used in literature. Using BONNI, we were able to design a 10-layer distributed Bragg reflector with only 4.5% mean spectral error, compared to the previously reported results of 7.8% error with 16 layers. Further designs of a broadband waveguide taper and photonic crystal waveguide transition validate the capabilities of BONNI."}

The theory is suitable for any material with vanishingly thin thickness relative to the light wavelength, independent of the geometry of the material and the media interfacing it. We apply the formalism to a uniaxial excitonic sheet, covering a large number of two-dimensional (2D) materials and organic thin films. Our theory reveals pairs of polaritonic resonances originating from the IP and OOP components of the excitonic dipole moment. The formalism suggests experimentally accessible signatures of dipole moment orientation, enhanced by near-field probes.

In classical transmission, the relevant Raman effect is stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and recent studies have examined it in space-division multiplexing (SDM) fibers. An intrinsic relation between SpRS and SRS allows previous SRS results to inform SpRS models. In this work, we extend SpRS models derived for single-mode fibers (SMFs) to SDM fibers with multiple mode groups of degenerate modes, covering both Stokes and anti-Stokes bands. The proposed model is a useful, fiber-design-independent tool for evaluating scattered noise in optical links, and it is validated through experimental measurements in field-deployed multi-core fibers (MCFs) and multi-mode fiber (MMF), showing good agreement."}

Our proposed method is general-purpose, does not require introducing any additional components to the photonic network, and can address errors stemming from unbalanced losses, 50/50 beamsplitter deviations, digital-to-analog conversion inaccuracies, and any unknown sources. In particular, we show that our method is highly effective in mitigating unbalanced-loss errors, a problem that has not previously been addressed by any error-correction technique.

A 2D grating creating this illumination is stepped across one period to acquire a set of images at unique illumination positions. The Fourier domain of each image is described as a linear combination of replicated sample information at each frequency harmonic. As this superposition is created independently of detection, it contains spatial information exceeding native detector resolution. Recovering the encoded high-frequency components enables the population of an expanded frequency space. We demonstrate the presence of additional sample information in the Fourier spectrum and introduce a method to recover it. We achieve a resolution improvement by a factor of 2.1 for the projection image of a resolution test pattern. We further demonstrate seamless integration into standard X-ray tomography acquisition schemes. The acquisition is inherently multimodal, as phase-contrast and dark-field images can be computed from the same data using methods such as unified modulated pattern analysis, while providing an additional super-resolved transmission channel. These results indicate broad potential for non-destructive testing and biomedical imaging, as they alleviate pixel-size limitations in photon-counting detectors and sample-size restrictions imposed by optical magnification."}

Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state searches of spin Hamiltonians, implemented on various physical platforms whose intrinsic dynamics are analogous to spin systems. However, the complex energy landscape of spin Hamiltonians often traps the system in local minima, preventing the system from reaching the ground-state (global minimum). We demonstrate an intrinsic feedback-driven annealing mechanism in class-B semiconductor laser arrays arising from the interplay of internal ($α$) and external ($η$) coupling. The instantaneous phase configuration self-modulates amplitude fluctuations, which act as an effective temperature, dynamically reshaping the potential and enabling the system to escape from local minima. Using a one-dimensional ring laser array, we analyze defect formation in the $α$-$η$ parameter space and identify an optimal regime achieving nearly 100% ground-state probability. Although both $α$ and $η$ are essential for the feedback loop, defect suppression results from modifying two competing timescales: amplitude stabilization (t_amp) and phase locking (t_phase), analogous to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. These timescales can be tuned independently via $α$ or $η$. Identical timescale ratios yield identical defect probabilities, confirming that relative timescales, not specific parameters, govern defect formation. Our findings establish internal feedback-driven annealing as a practical route to ground-state search in semiconductor laser arrays, providing a foundation for efficient and scalable laser-based spin simulators for tackling hard optimization problems."}

As such, it has found wide adoption for the theoretical and computational description of multiple-scattering phenomena. In its original form, the T-matrix describes the interaction of a scatterer with a monochromatic source. In practice, however, information about the T-matrix is usually needed in an extended spectral domain. To access the frequency-dispersion, one might naively sample T-matrices over a finely resolved set of discrete frequencies and store one T-matrix per frequency. This approach has multiple drawbacks: it is computationally expensive, requires excessive memory, and it disregards the physical origin of the spectral features, weakening physical interpretability. To overcome these major limitations, we leverage a pole-expansion technique to represent the T-matrix with arbitrary frequency resolution within a selected frequency domain via a set of resonant contributions. A matrix-valued variant of the recently established adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational approximation enables us to compute the pole-expansion at minimal computational cost using only a small number of direct evaluations. We demonstrate the benefits of such a representation with examples ranging from semi-analytically accessible scatterers to quasi-dual bound states in the continuum. To allow the wider community to capitalize on these findings, we provide open-source tools to perform the presented pole-expansion of the T-matrix."}

Here, we demonstrate the concept of geometric phase matching as a new paradigm for tunable nonlinear wave mixing, based on a multilayered platform of nonlinear thin-film crystals. We leverage this concept to experimentally show reconfigurable and spin-controlled phase matching for second-harmonic generation (SHG), opening new avenues for real-time manipulation of nonlinear interactions in photonic devices. We specifically demonstrate full modulation of SHG from a bilayer structure, nearly perfect and tunable geometric phase matching from an eight-layer structure, and polarization tomography that reveals the evolution of the spin dependent interaction. This approach not only expands the design space for nonlinear optical processes but also paves the way for highly robust, tunable and efficient frequency conversion, for next-generation adaptive nonlinear photonic, quantum photonic and nonlinear optical metamaterial technologies based on thin-film crystals."}
