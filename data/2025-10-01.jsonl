Static magnetic\nfield-induced changes in plasmonic far-field response stem from the classical\nHall effect and are generally very small in noble metals within the visible\nfrequency range at readily accessible magnetic fields. Planar plasmonic tunnel\njunctions allow the study of nanogap LSPRs through current-driven light\nemission. We find that the electroluminescence of such junctions is modulated\nby tens of percent with a magnetic field of a few Teslas, exceeding Hall-based\nexpectations by orders of magnitude. Complementary quantum mechanical and\nelectromagnetic modeling reveals that a modest static magnetic field can\nintroduce significant chirality in the transition dipoles generated during the\nelectron tunneling process. This strongly affects the excitation of LSPRs and\nleads to magnetic-field sensitive far-field electroluminescent emission. This\nis a new paradigm for tunable nanoscale light sources."}

It has traditionally been\nconfined to specific domains: terahertz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet,\neach requiring distinct comb sources and detection mechanisms tailored to the\nnature of the spectroscopic target. Yet, similar techniques may be implemented\nin the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions, such as optical\nrectification for comb generation and electro-optic sampling for detection,\nboth using crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. However, in the Reststrahlen\nband near phonon resonances in these crystals, typically between 5 and 10 THz,\nboth linear and nonlinear susceptibilities experience abnormally high\ndispersion, and light propagation is strongly suppressed. This confines DCS\noperation to spectral regions either below or above the Reststrahlen band and\neffectively separating the THz and MIR domains. Here we demonstrate\nhigh-resolution DCS performed simultaneously over two broad spectral bands,\neach spanning an octave or more. The measurements cover both the MIR (350-1150\ncm$^{-1}$; 8.7-28.5 $\\mu$m; 10.5-34.5 THz) and the THz region (80-160\ncm$^{-1}$; 62.5-125 $\\mu$m; 2.4-4.8 THz), effectively bridging these\ntraditionally separate regions within a single acquisition.

These cavities are engineered for deterministic\ncoupling to a monolayer (or few-layer) excitonic material, producing strong\nnear-field localization directly beneath the 2D material. Photoluminescence\n(PL) measurements show reproducible tenfold enhancements relative to bare\nsilicon, consistent with numerical simulations that account for material\nabsorption and fabrication tolerances. Furthermore, time-resolved PL\nmeasurements reveal pronounced lifetime shortening and non-exponential\ndynamics, indicating cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions. The\noptimized cavity geometry enhances the far-field collection efficiency and\nsupports scalable integration with van der Waals semiconductors. Our results\nshow that the arrays of topology-optimized dielectric cavities are a versatile,\nscalable platform for controlling excitonic emission and interactions, which\ncreates new opportunities in nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, and quantum\nphotonics."}
