Two different strategies are proposed to solve the problem. In the first one, Bloch's assumption is first applied to the equations of motion, and then the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the complex normal form style in the parametrisation method is applied. This direct procedure, which applies first the wave dependency to the original physical coordinates of the problem, is referred to as CNF-BP (for CNF applied with Bloch's assumption on physical coordinates). In the second strategy, the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the parametrisation method, which relates the physical coordinates to the so-called normal coordinates, is first applied. Then the periodic assumption is used, thus imposing a Bloch wave ansatz on the normal coordinates. This method will be referred to as CNF-PN (for CNF with a periodic assumption on normal coordinates). In the conservative case, the CNF-PN strategy exhibits superior capability in capturing complex wave propagation phenomena, whereas the CNF-BP strategy encounters limitations in handling non-fundamental harmonics and the nonlinear interactions between host oscillators. For underdamped systems, the CNF-PN is rigorously validated and systematically compared against numerical techniques, a classical analytical perturbation technique (the method of multiple scales), and direct numerical time integration of annular chain structures."}

We introduce a simpler method using a continuous-wave laser with weak phase modulation and a slow photodetector, directly inspired by Bragg-like spectroscopy in fluids of light. During propagation, the red and blue-detuned sidebands accumulate different dispersive phase shifts, leading to oscillations in the transmitted modulation contrast as the modulation frequency is scanned. Vanishing contrast at well-defined frequencies directly yields the GVD. We apply this technique to hot rubidium vapors and observe the strong frequency dependence of the GVD across a broad detuning range of the D2 line at different temperatures."}

Supplementary Material: 6 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental tool in modern laser technology, enabling coherent frequency conversion to remote optical bands, serving as the basis for self-referenced femtosecond lasers and quadrature-squeezed light sources. State-of-the-art SHG relies on bulk crystals and ridge waveguides, although continuous-wave (CW) SH efficiency in bulk crystals is limited by short interaction lengths and large mode areas. Ridge waveguides offer better performance with lower pump power requirements, yet must span several centimeters to deliver high output power, complicating fabrication and narrowing the bandwidth. Recently, SHG in periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonic circuits has attracted significant interest, offering orders-of-magnitude improvement in SHG under CW pumping due to the stronger optical mode confinement. However, lithium niobate has a low optical damage threshold, even in MgO-doped substrates, which limits SH power output to well below the watt level. Here, we overcome this challenge and demonstrate 7 mm-long periodically poled thin-film lithium tantalate (PPLT) waveguides that achieve high SH output in the CW regime, with generated power exceeding 1 W and off-chip output above 0.5 W at 775 nm under 4.5 W pump power. PPLT offers a higher optical damage threshold than PPLN and supports watt-level operation. By optimizing electrode geometry and poling conditions, we obtain reproducible poling despite lithium tantalate's coercive field being nearly four times higher than that of MgO-doped lithium niobate. Although its effective nonlinearity is more than five times lower, we achieve watt-level CW output with a short waveguide, demonstrating the potential of PPLT circuits for high-power applications in integrated lasers, quantum photonics, AMO physics, optical clocks, and frequency metrology."}

In particular, static meta-optical encoders designed for task-specific pre-processing demonstrated orders of magnitude smaller energy consumption over purely digital counterpart, albeit at the cost of slight degradation in classification accuracy. However, a lack of generalizability poses serious challenges for wide deployment of static meta-optical front-ends. Here, we investigate the utility of a metalens for generalized computer vision. Specifically, we show that a metalens optimized for full-color imaging can achieve image classification accuracy comparable to high-end, sensor-limited optics and consistently outperforms a hyperboloid metalens across a wide range of sensor pixel sizes. We further design an end-to-end single aperture metasurface for ImageNet classification and find that the optimized metasurface tends to balance the modulation transfer function (MTF) for each wavelength. Together, these findings highlight that the preservation of spatial frequency-domain information is an essential interpretable factor underlying ONN performance. Our work provides both an interpretable understanding of task-driven optical optimization and practical guidance for designing high-performance ONNs and meta-optical encoders for generalizable computer vision."}

Two identical copies of the unknown quantum field illuminate laterally displaced slits, guaranteeing perfect spatiotemporal mode matching without a separate local oscillator. In the far-field, detection at transverse position $x$ is associated with a relative slit phase $φ(x)$, and an $N$-photon event projects the detected quantum field onto a state $|N;φ(x)\\rangle$. The resulting distribution $P(N,φ)$ is the quantum analogue of a Frequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) trace: whereas FROG reconstructs the classical complex spectral field $E(ω)$ from a spectrally resolved second harmonic of a pulse with its delayed self, our measurement reconstructs the Fock-space wavefunction or density matrix from binomially weighted self-interference. The scheme requires no known or mode-matched reference and is compatible with commercially available photon-number-resolving cameras. Beyond conceptual simplicity and automatic mode matching, the FROG analogy permits direct transfer of mature ultrafast-optics methodologies (e.g., mixed-state, ptychographic, and vectorial extensions) into quantum optics, offering a versatile route to tomography of quantum photon states."}

Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly. Our approach generalizes to other types of emitters, including atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, thus providing a practical tool for analyzing collective behavior in realistic quantum systems."}

Among the latter, outstand vdW oxochlorides with in-plane axes of a different physical character (metallic or dielectric).

Three samples of standard single-mode optical fibers (SMF) are sequentially inserted in a syringe loaded with a 1 mL solution of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) and methanol, and a high-power laser is injected into the fibers for 5 (SMF 1), 10 (SMF 2), and 20 (SMF 3) minutes. The CNT solution thermally expands and generates vortex acoustic flows, which are confined in the syringe cavity, significantly increasing the velocity and impact of nanotubes at the fiber tip. The resulting shock waves achieve estimated hypersonic velocities (5742 m/s) and high pressures (6.7 GPa), overcoming the silica tensile strength and ablating structured vortices in the fibers. The material, geometry, and depth profile of the vortices are characterized, providing details of mixing carbon and silica layers, increasing radially from the fiber core center and in thickness to the cladding for longer laser periods (850 nm to 10 micron thickness). The cross-sections of the measured vortices are compared to analytical simulations, revealing unprecedented Fibonacci helices drilling holes in the fiber core with a 5 micron maximum depth, while depositing nanoscale CNT-silica layers following Fibonacci spirals. These achievements point out a new route for laser-controlled deposition of nanoparticles and fabrication of vortex devices on fiber tips, which is promising for all-fiber vortex spatial phase modulators in optical communications, fiber sensors, high-power pulsed fiber lasers, and biomedical ultrasonic neurotransmitters."}

Efficient inverse design benefits from differentiable models of light-structure interaction. While traditional full-wave solvers based on finite differences, finite elements, or Fourier modal methods have already been presented for that purpose, a dedicated tool adapted for performing multiple scattering simulations is still lacking. To overcome this limitation, we provide a multiple-scattering framework compatible to automatic differentiation, suitable for treating periodic and non-periodic arrangements of scatterers. It yields exact gradients regarding geometric and positional parameters in finite clusters and infinite metasurfaces. In this work, we use spheres as the elementary building blocks to demonstrate the framework's capabilities as a standalone tool. However, the framework is adaptable to arbitrarily shaped scatterers, provided the individual T-matrices are calculated using differentiable full-wave Maxwell solvers. Since the gradients are obtained simultaneously in a single backward pass, the framework is well-suited for moderately dimensional problems. It is also possible to combine multiple performance goals into a single objective function. The versatility of our method is illustrated in proof-of-concept examples that focus on various aspects of Kerker-type physics. In the first example, a finite cluster of scatterers is optimized in order to reach a high forward-to-backward scattering ratio, and we show experimental feasibility of the designs. In the second example, a metasurface made from multiple scatterers in each unit cell is designed to maximize the reflectance contrast between orthogonal linear polarizations of the incident light.

By intro ducing a chiral-symmetric Hamiltonian, this study reveals the topological effects at such temporal interfaces. We find that the reflection and refraction coefficients exhibit a topological braiding struc ture. This structure is directly determined by the difference in the topological invariants across the interface, establishing a bulk-boundary correspondence for temporal interfaces in non-Hermitian systems.

However, the requirement for tunable and low-noise laser sources considerably increases the cost and the size of the system, thereby limiting the industrial applicability of the microresonator-based technology. Here, we explore the possibility of using a low-cost fixed-frequency semiconductor laser as the pump laser to perform radiofrequency electrometry. A resonant mode in a lithium niobate microresonator is frequency-locked to the laser using the electrooptic effect. This same effect also underlies the radiofrequency electric-field sensing mechanism. Our experimental results show that the electrometry resolution can be maintained at signal frequencies beyond the optical resonance bandwidth and that the signal-to-noise ratio does not change with varied coupling conditions as long as the laser frequency noise is the dominant noise source of the system. In addition, narrowband electrooptic sensitivity enhancement is observed at frequencies of the microresonator's piezoelectric resonances, resulting in a resolution enhancement factor of approximately 3 at signal frequencies around 4 MHz. Our work advances the photonic resonant electrometry technology by studying the bandwidth limitation, and opens the road to the employment of low-cost lasers in high-resolution sensing applications."}

A noise-robust wrapped-number search is used to select per-pixel integer pairs (k1, k2), and a global refinement with circular TV regularization and soft bounds improves stability and preserves height discontinuities. The approach is validated through rigorous scattering-model-based simulations and experiments on structured silicon samples, demonstrating accurate height recovery in regimes where single-wavelength FPT exhibits phase wrapping. We analyze the limits of the FPT forward model and identify aspect ratio (AR) and phase modulation transfer function (ph-MTF) as key predictors of reconstruction fidelity.

Using quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs), we demonstrate how to control the hybridization of modes with opposite symmetries, resulting in Rabi-like splitting between the hybrid states in the regime of strong electromagnetic mode coupling. Beyond revealing the physical origin of the hybrid modes, our model predicts and explains the emergence of dual-band asymmetric reflection and absorption, and how to achieve maximum directional absorption difference. The theoretical predictions are verified by full-wave simulations, showing very good agreement with theory. Furthermore, very strong reciprocal bianisotropy is demonstrated with the use of q-BICs in a deeply subwavelength metasurface in the optical frequency range.
