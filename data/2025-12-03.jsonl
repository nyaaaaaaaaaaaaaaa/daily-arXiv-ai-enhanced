Here we report a monolithic, inverse-designed potassium bromide (KBr) lens that achieves broadband, near-achromatic focusing from 0.45 to 14 $μ$m, a continuous spectral span covering the visible, near-, mid-, and long-wave infrared. This corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 1.9, approaching the theoretical limit of 2, while maintaining a nearly constant focal length across the entire range. The 19-mm-diameter, 22.5-mm-focal-length optic enables a single compact platform for hyperspectral imaging, mid-IR microscopy, super-resolution, imaging through scattering media, and simultaneous multi-band and long-range imaging. Coupling the KBr lens with a conventional refractive element further yields a hybrid telescope that extends these capabilities. By uniting inverse design with scalable manufacturing, this approach provides a route toward broadly deployable ultra-broadband imagers for biomedicine, climate and environmental monitoring, and space-based sensing."}

The values are extracted from spectroscopically observed microcavity resonances in thin $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ membranes embedded between fully and partially reflective gold mirrors. Refined Varshni and Paessler models are used to describe temperature-dependent bandgap shifts and material composition. By tracking resonance shifts and benchmarking against finite-difference time-domain simulations, we derive the dispersive optical response with high precision. This yields a quantitatively improved analytical expression for the refractive index of $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ matching the experimental results with a coefficient of determination as high as $R^2=0.993$, enabling accurate modeling near the band edge at cryogenic temperatures. The method is straightforward and broadly applicable to other semiconductor systems, offering a valuable tool for the design of micro photonic devices such as quantum light sources."}

Our analysis leads to a generalized form of Huygens' principle for hyperbolic waves, connecting to the emergence of negative refraction and focusing with hyperbolic media.

The 6x6 electromagnetic polarization matrix introduced here generalizes the conventional electric 3x3 matrix by incorporating both electric and magnetic contributions together with their mutual correlations. It consists of diagonal 3x3 blocks, representing the electric and magnetic polarization matrices, and off-diagonal 3x3 blocks that encode the full structure of electric-magnetic cross-correlations. The information contained in this matrix can be interpreted through physically meaningful quantities such as active and reactive energy fluxes, in-phase and quadrature alignment matrices, and global indices describing electric-magnetic coupling. The formalism is applied to a field composed of two orthogonally propagating plane waves sharing a common linear electric polarization (a simple yet physically realizable configuration) that demonstrates the need for a general combined electric-magnetic representation even in free space. This approach provides a comprehensive and unified framework for characterizing electromagnetic polarization beyond the electric-field description alone, bridging classical statistical optics with quantum-like density-matrix interpretations."}

To reduce losses in this regime, materials with both near-zero permittivity and $n<1$ refractive index, known as near-zero-index (NZI) materials, are desired. When both conditions are satisfied, the resulting region is classified as a low-loss ENZ medium combining strong light confinement with reduced optical losses. To achieve this behavior in the mid-IR, heavily doped semiconductors are required, and those compatible with current technologies are most desirable. This work provides the first in-depth study, supported by experimental demonstrations, of the plasmonic properties of highly doped GaN thin films on Si, exhibiting low optical losses and low-loss ENZ characteristics up to $3μm$. From the extracted optical parameters, the ENZ and NZI regions are determined and compared with the existing literature. As a result of the large polar character of nitrides, a hybridization of the surface plasmon and phonon polaritons is observed, accompanied by a flat-dispersion of the high-energy mode (pinned near the plasma frequency) indicative of its ENZ character. Establishing GaN as a viable platform for mid-IR ENZ-based plasmonics paves the way for integration into future infrared photonic technologies."}

Here, we present an efficient, broadband interface capable of converting multiple higher-order free-space Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes into corresponding waveguide modes using the multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) scheme. We experimentally demonstrate low-crosstalk mode conversion between various set of three LG modes, and the first three TE modes of a multimode silicon waveguide across the telecom C-band.

Yet, their practical implementation remains limited by the intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities of conventional materials, which demand high power and large footprints to achieve significant nonlinear responses. Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter excitations of semiconducting materials, offer a promising solution by combining strong optical nonlinearities with the high speed and large scalability typical of photonic devices. However, despite their potential, working on-chip polaritonic elements demonstrating room temperature coherent lasing, controllable nonlinear propagation, or amplification have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate a fully integrated perovskite polaritonic circuit that overcomes these limitations. Using a single-step microfluidic lithographic technique, we realize waveguide circuits with integrated gratings that simultaneously act as couplers and mirrors, forming in-plane Fabry-Pérot cavities. These structures support robust in-plane polariton lasing between gratings, yielding coherent emission along the waveguide. Furthermore, we observe clear signatures of strong nonlinear self-phase modulation and, for the first time, optical amplification of guided polaritons at room temperature. Our simple, scalable platform opens the way to low-power, highly nonlinear optical circuits for integrated photonics and neuromorphic architectures operating at room temperature."}

Specifically, we used the Double Helix PSF (DH-PSF) in which a single fluorescent source gives rise to two lobes in the image plane with the lobes rotating in the plane as the particle moves along the optical axis. We designed simple estimators of the relative error between the particle and the tracker, and a simple proportional feedback controller to regulate that error to zero. We explored the efficacy of the approach through simulation studies, demonstrating the tracking of fast-moving particles (with diffusion coefficients up to 10 {μ\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}}) over long time periods (multiple seconds)."}

However, achieving such low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs is nontrivial as long cavities require substantially higher pump power, which induces stronger thermal effects that, in turn, exacerbate thermal instability and complicate access to stable soliton states. The dual-mode pumping scheme, in which a continuous-wave pump couples to both the comb-generating mode and an auxiliary mode, has proven simple and effective for mitigating thermal instability and enabling thermally accessible soliton generation. Yet, in long-cavity devices, the standard bus-to-resonator coupling conditions for these two modes diverge substantially, resulting in insufficient pump coupling to the auxiliary mode, which makes dual-mode pumping particularly challenging for low-repetition-rate microcombs. In this work, we overcome this limitation by coupling the pump to the auxiliary mode via inter-modal coupling, which can be introduced in racetrack microresonators and engineered by tailoring the cavity bend design. We validate this approach in a high-Q (>$10^7$) silicon nitride microresonator and demonstrate thermally accessible, deterministic single-soliton generation at a repetition rate of 33 GHz. This work provides a simple and robust pathway for generating low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs."}

However,the flying focus generated with conventional approaches suffers from a low maximum intensity, as the energy is spread over a long distance, and the size of the focusing optics is also limited. Here, we propose a zone-plate-based flying focus scheme in which the zone widths are modulated by a sinusoidal random distribution. Numerical simulations show that the high-order foci produced by the modulated zone plate can be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the scheme sustains a high-intensity focal region extending over more than 100 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, the focal speed can be tuned over a wide range, including values exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. Owing to these advantages, the proposed modulated zone-plate scheme offers new possibilities for high-intensity laser physics and holds promise for applications such as laser wakefield acceleration, photon acceleration, and more."}

Here, we present a demonstration of a drop-casting based approach to introduce ultrafast plasmonic-mediated coupling: a sparse-layer of silica-gold core-shell nanoparticles is deposited directly onto a W/Fe/Pt spintronic trilayer. This sparse (six percent) decoration increases the wafer-averaged THz pulse energy, pointing to a very high local conversion enhancement for this low-coverage spintronic emitter compared with the bare stack.
