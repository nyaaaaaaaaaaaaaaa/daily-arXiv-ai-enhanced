While phase sensing offers enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional spectroscopy methods, this sensitivity often makes systems more vulnerable to external factors such as vibrations, introducing instability and noise. In this work, we demonstrate a broadband and AI-enhanced interferometry method, denoted general polarization common-path interferometry (GPCPI), that relaxes the polarization constraints of traditional common-path interferometry. The polarization decoupling feature enables simultaneous amplitude and phase measurements supplemented with deep neural autoencoders to detect phase anomalies in the spectrum through the analysis of second order derivative mapping of the phase profile, enhancing the accuracy of broadband phase measurements. The approach enables an order of magnitude improvement in phase stability compared to state-of-the-art interferometry techniques, leading to higher accuracy in phase sensing. Plasmonic metasurface phase sensing and hyperspectral single-cell dispersion imaging demonstrate the capability and sensitivity of the method over conventional spectroscopy. Our own adopted version of deep learning model, ConvNeXt V2, enables single-shot and real-time tracking of phase variation with minimized noise. Interference fringes over the cell cultured samples reveal the fingerprints of the normal (CCD-32Sk) vs cancerous (COLO-829) skin cells, enabling robust cell classification and disease diagnosis at single-cell level. The proposed interferometry technique offers a reliable, compact, and stable solution for broadband phase measurements and single-cell dispersion imaging for applications in metrology, molecular diagnostics, drug discovery, and quantum sensing."}

Compared with active components like spatial light modulators (SLMs) that have become widely used to generate trap arrays, metasurfaces provide an indefinitely scalable number of pixels, enabling large arrays of complex traps in a very small form factor, as well as reduced dynamic noise. To design metasurfaces that can generate three-dimensional bottle beams to serve as dark traps, we modified the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to enforce complex-amplitude profiles at the focal plane of the metasurface and to optimize the uniformity of the traps across the array. We fabricated and measured c-SOS metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian laser beam into arrays of bright traps, dark traps, and interleaved bright/dark traps."}

For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology."}

To facilitate the mathematical operations in electromagnetic (EM) space, here we propose a space-time coding metasurface (STCM) system capable of directly performing calculus operations on the spatial energy distributions of EM waves. By exploiting harmonic characteristics induced by time-varying coding, the responses of meta-atoms at specific harmonics can be flexibly controlled, which enables the metasurface system to address more complex tasks. Owing to its programmability, the STCM can dynamically switch functions in real time to accommodate different calculus tasks. To fully leverage the capability of STCM, we not only present the space-time coding sequences for differentiation and integration of EM waves, but also develop and numerically simulate the space-time coding sequences that can independently and simultaneously implement different calculus operations on the same incident EM waves. To experimentally validate the feasibility of the EM calculus operations, proof-of-concept experiments are conducted using a programmable 2-bit STCM. Good agreements among the theory, numerical simulations, and experiments confirm the feasibility of performing calculus operations in the EM space and demonstrate the broad application prospects of STCM in EM wave manipulations, wireless communications, and signal processing."}

Here, we introduce a programmable \"chaos-on-comb\" architecture that overcomes this limitation using standard electro-optic components. By heterodyning a delayed-feedback chaotic laser with a continuous-wave reference, a broadband chaotic microwave signal is generated to simultaneously drive a cascaded electro-optic comb, imprinting chaotic dynamics across all comb lines and merging them into an ultra-broadband chaotic continuum. Then, incorporating spectrum slicing enables flexible extraction of parallel chaotic channels with preserved statistical independence and per-channel programmability. As a result, we demonstrate a single-channel ultra-broadband optical chaos with an effective bandwidth of 543.8 GHz, and a broadband terahertz noise source with an excess noise ratio of 52.99 \\pm 2.85 dB to validate its flatness. Furthermore, we employ the uncorrelated parallel chaos for ultrafast photonic decision-making in a 256-armed bandit problem, achieving a favourable power-law scaling exponent of 0.86.

The GWs consist of a non-circular gyrotropic (i.e., gyroelectric and gyromagnetic) core and an infinitely extending isotropic cladding. To solve this problem, we develop two independent full-wave methods. The first technique is an extended integral equation (EIE) method, an extension of a previously developed EIE used to calculate the propagation constants in composite dielectric-isotropic waveguides. The second technique is a Chebyshev expansion method (CEM). In both implementations, the electric and magnetic fields in the gyrotropic core are expanded in superpotential-based cylindrical vector wave functions (SUPER-CVWFs), recently developed for the problem of oblique multiple scattering by gyrotropic cylinders. Both techniques allow us to calculate the propagation constants in the general case, without approximations. Various non-circular gyrotropic waveguides are considered. The EIE and CEM results are validated against a commercial finite element solver, and the accuracy and computational performance of both methods are benchmarked. A microwave application is presented where the complex propagation constants of ferrite rods are computed in the presence of an external magnetic flux density bias. Our work advances the theory of propagation in open waveguides, from dielectric/isotropic to gyrotropic ones, and enables the design of contemporary waveguiding structures."}

We analyze the problem of the coupling between classical electromagnetic fields in a cavity and a movable mirror, considering both nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes of motion. Starting from the equations of motion for a mirror subject to a generic external potential, we provide a variational formulation of the mirror-radiation interaction. Within this framework, a single-mode variational approximation is introduced, which captures the essential dynamical features of the coupled system. In the special case of a mirror undergoing free motion, the variational method yields an exact solution. This unified treatment highlights the connection between different dynamical regimes and provides a basis for analyzing applications ranging from precision interferometry to relativistic radiation-pressure effects."}

Conventional photoacoustic systems rely on externally delivered light and are therefore constrained by optical attenuation, limiting imaging depths to several centimeters.

By exploiting the weak attenuation of low-MHz ultrasound, acoustic energy is transmitted through tissue to wirelessly power a pulsed laser diode. The emitted light pulses generate photoacoustic signals that encode local optical absorption at clinically relevant depths, which could enable imaging in regions such as the gastrointestinal tract that are inaccessible to surface-based illumination. We demonstrate this approach by imaging through a 12 cm thick phantom, establishing a pathway toward deep-tissue photoacoustic imaging."}

Due to their saturability, quantum emitters exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinearity compared with conventional materials. Using physics-aware training, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture can solve complex tasks, including nonlinear classification and reinforcement learning, which have not been realized in all-optical neural networks. To enable fair comparison across different platforms, we introduce a framework that quantitatively links nonlinearity to a network's expressive power. Analysis shows that our quantum activation, operating below nW/μm^2 intensity, reduces the power budget by seven orders of magnitude.

Lateral optical forces, which act perpendicular to the direction of beam propagation, are particularly intriguing but have largely been restricted to interface geometries such as air - water boundaries. Here, we realize tunable lateral optical force entirely within a fluid environment by using Janus particles: dielectric microspheres half-coated with gold. We show that the lateral optical force arises from scattering asymmetry induced by the asymmetric structure of the particles; it can be tuned by adjusting the polarization angle of a linearly polarized beam, but also particle parameters including their size and orientation. Experimentally, we directly observe fully reversible lateral propulsion of Janus particles in water merely by rotating the polarization direction, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a new mechanism for programmable, polarization-controlled optical manipulation, with promising implications for biophotonics, microfluidics, and active soft-matter systems."}

Recently, these two scenarios have been unified under a more general framework known as anyonic-PT symmetry, yet its physical implications in waveguide platforms and corresponding topological features in extended lattice systems remain largely unexplored. Here, the phase transitions and topological protection in anyonic-PT-symmetric systems are systematically investigated in waveguide lattices. In the symmetry-unbroken regime, the arguments of all bulk eigenvalues are constrained to two discrete values separated by π, leading to distinctive oscillatory propagation dynamics accompanied by controlled amplification or dissipation. In the case of one-dimensional lattice, the energy bands exhibit a gap closing and reopening during phase transition. Moreover, in the symmetry-unbroken regime, the topological edge states emerge within the bulk gap and are protected by a generalized pseudo-anyonic-Hermiticity (PAH) symmetry.

Here, we introduce topologically compact edge states protected by SubSy, featuring extreme two-site localization at boundaries of a lattice, without any decay into the bulk. The compactness arises from local destructive interference at the boundary, while topological protection is ensured by SubSy, characterized by quantized winding numbers.

Here, we investigate this interplay by considering a synthetic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with all-to-all nonlocal interactions. We find that the distinctive nonlinearity maintains an effective chiral symmetry and leads to a quantized nonlinear winding and Berry phase, as corroborated by the developed Bogoliubov nonlinear adiabatic theory. Increasing nonlinearity drives a sequence of topological transitions signaled by the appearance of characteristic swallowtail band structures at intermediate interaction strengths and band swapping in the strong nonlinear regime. The band swapping results in quantized fractional windings and double-period Bloch oscillations that are closely related to discrete time crystals. Remarkably, even starting from a topologically trivial linear system, nonlocal nonlinearity can induce an emergent topological phase with fractional windings. Experimentally, our model can be realized using photons in a degenerate optical cavity with Rydberg-mediated interactions. Our results establish a rigorous framework and pave the way for exploring nonlinear topological phenomena and their applications in synthetic quantum platforms."}

This review presents a mechanism-based classification of SPEs, offering a physics-oriented framework to clarify the performance limitations of conventional sources, including quantum emitters and nonlinear optical processes. Particular attention is given to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (HOIP QDs), which provide size- and composition-tunable emission with narrow linewidths and room-temperature operation. Through comparative analysis of physical mechanisms and performance metrics, we show how HOIP QDs may address key limitations of established SPE platforms. Recognizing the constraints of current deterministic sources, we introduce a performance framework to guide the development of scalable SPEs, and examine the theoretical potential of bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) states, discussing how BSV mechanisms could serve as a promising avenue for multiplexable, high-purity photon generation beyond conventional heralded schemes. The review concludes by outlining future directions for integrating HOIP- and BSV-based concepts into scalable quantum photonic architectures."}

Yet, their efficient generation at high average power remains limited by thermal effects, phase-matching constraints, and material damage. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz and UV generation driven by a common Yb:KGW laser operating from at 40 - 600 kHz. THz radiation is produced by optical rectification in stoichiometric MgO:LiNbO$_3$ using a line-focus geometry, yielding single-cycle pulses of 55 - 92 nJ energy with peak electric fields of 37 - 90 kV/cm. Electro-optic sampling and beam-quality measurements reveal tunable control between central frequency, bandwidth and field amplitude by translating the generation region transversely within the crystal. Using shorter pump pulses preserves THz conversion efficiency, while longer pulses at 100 kHz reduce THz output by up to a factor of four due to cumulative thermal effects. Femtosecond 257.5 nm UV pulses are generated by cascaded fourth-harmonic generation in $β$-barium borate with conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% at 40 kHz and stable operation up to 600 kHz. These results demonstrate a compact, thermally robust platform for high-average-power nonlinear conversion and are directly relevant to next-generation high-repetition-rate ultrafast electron diffraction and spectroscopy systems."}
