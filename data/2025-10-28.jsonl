Here, we introduce an\nalternative architecture that sorts spatial modes natural to circularly\nsymmetric apertures: Zernike polynomials. Using conventional optics hardware\nand even-order vortex phase plates, we show how to assemble a series of vortex\nphase filters that can in principle separate the various Zernike polynomials\nlosslessly and without crosstalk.

For general nanophotonic cavities, this ratio of the quantum to the\nclassical description is typically below unity and varies with the material\ndispersion properties, scattering-to-absorption ratio and morphology of the\ncavity. Notably, the two descriptions converge for lossless, non-dispersive\ndielectric cavities and for noble-metal plasmonic cavities with sufficiently\nlow scattering losses."}

Among tuning mechanisms, all-optical coherent control stands out because\nit requires no material or geometric change, enabling ultrafast, low-energy,\ninterference-based modulation of amplitude, phase, and polarization in\nultrathin devices. However, when applied to phase-gradient metasurfaces,\ncoherent control has been limited to small apertures effectively confined to a\nsingle Fresnel zone, leading to large divergence and degraded beam quality.\nHere we propose and numerically validate a scalable method that enables\nlarge-area coherent control. The key idea is to use coherent illumination to\ntune the phase gradient within each Fresnel zone while a direct search\nalgorithm optimizes zone-by-zone parameters to meet system-level targets. Using\nthis principle, we demonstrate continuous tuning of a large-area metasurface\nfor continuous beam-steering without per-meta-atom phase actuation. The same\nframework applies broadly to continuously tunable phase-gradient optics,\nincluding varifocal metalenses, parfocal zoom metalenses, tunable axicons, and\nrelated dynamic focusing elements."}
