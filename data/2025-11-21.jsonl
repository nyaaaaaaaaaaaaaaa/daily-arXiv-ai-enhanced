While nanophotonic platforms offer a route to enhance chiral light-matter interactions, existing device concepts for chiral sensing remain heuristic, resulting in limited chiral enhancement and control over chiral hotspot placement within nanostructures. Here, we introduce an inverse-design framework that directly optimizes superchiral near fields in photonic nanostructures and demonstrate its powerful opportunities for enantioselective analysis. We first show that freeform achiral metasurfaces can be optimized to achieve an 800-fold chiral density enhancement, with fully customizable chiral hotspot placement for direct molecular interaction. We further demonstrate ultrasensitive detection of chiral analytes and achieve a 116-fold increase in detection sensitivity over the native enantiomeric response. Lastly, we extend our platform to determine chiral-molecule concentration and resolve enantiomeric excess in chiral mixtures. Our framework offers a generic route to enabling nanophotonic platforms for detecting chiral compounds and can be integrated with a broad range of spin-based photonic materials for applications in valleytronics, chiral emission control, and topological photonics."}

Waveguide-fed metasurfaces are array-like radiating systems typically constructed from one or more waveguides loaded with a series of subwavelength metamaterial apertures that function as radiators. The use of subwavelength radiating elements distributed across the aperture enables electromagnetic field control with subwavelength precision, offering significant potential for near-field shaping. Leveraging these capabilities, we demonstrate that the near-field patterns of rectangular waveguide-fed metasurfaces can be tailored using the coupled dipole model, which accounts for mutual interactions between metamaterial radiating elements. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach are verified through full-wave simulations and experiments in the X-band."}

The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles. These results reveal that dissipative coupling cooperativity carries a clear physical meaning and serves as a key parameter for controlling phase transitions. Dissipative coupling offers an alternative paradigm for tailoring light matter interactions, paving the way for advances in both information processing and quantum technologies."}

Because standard OT configurations do not provide direct access to the axial position, axial detection typically relies on temporal fluctuations in forward-scattered optical power to infer the position of the particle. This approach generally assumes a linear-response regime in which the signal arises from the interference between the forward scattered and the nonscattered optical fields; however, under certain conditions, the backward-scattered contribution becomes non-negligible, leading to deviations from the linear response. Here, we present a simple yet comprehensive model for axial detection in standard OT while explicitly accounting for the backward-scattered field. Together with experimental validation, this framework neatly explains the standing-wave response observed when the backward-scattered field interferes with the nonscattered and the forward-scattered components, enabling accurate estimation of trap stiffness and particle diffusion under more general conditions. This work deepens our understanding of the phenomenology observed in real optical-tweezers measurements and extends their capabilities to conditions where standard approaches fail."}

Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language. Our experiments demonstrate that CoSP can design corresponding thin-film metamaterial structures for arbitrary multi-state, multi-band optical responses, showing great potentials in the intelligent design of RMMs for versatile applications."}

This paper presents a numerical study of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) hybrid III-V-on-silicon lasers, analyzing design trade-offs and optimization strategies based on supermode theory. The III-V section of the design incorporates InAs/(Al)GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which offer improved temperature insensitivity at the cost of more complex III-V/Si optical coupling, due to the high refractive index of (Al)GaAs. Consequently, many current laser designs rely on silicon waveguides with a thickness exceeding 220 nm, which helps coupling but limits their compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. To address this challenge, we perform detailed simulations focusing on 220-nm-thick silicon waveguides. We first examine how the mode profiles jointly depend on the silicon waveguide dimensions and the geometry and composition of the III-V stack. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel epitaxial design that enables effective III-V/Si coupling, with the optical mode strongly confined within the III-V waveguide in the gain section and efficiently transferred to the silicon waveguide in the passive sections. Moreover, the final design is shown to be robust to fabrication-induced deviations from nominal parameters."}

Stage I solves carrier-population and current equations at a single point, driven by a chirped super-Gaussian pulse. By fixing bandwidth and normalizing for intensity, we isolate a chirp-only response of plasma density, which exceeds unity and shows a consistent advantage for negative over positive chirp. Stage II propagates the field in water via the angular-spectrum method and applies the same equations across space. Normal dispersion reverses the trend: the chirp-only plasma density decreases as chirp grows, negative chirp remains less detrimental, and suppression is strongest for longer FTL pulses (e.g., 80 fs) due to dispersion-induced temporal spreading and spatio-temporal desynchronization. This study separates spectral-phase effects from bandwidth and intensity, yields testable predictions for water jets, and provides a foundation for future experiments and self-consistent propagation models."}

In our approach, a two-dimensional disperser and a high-speed digital micromirror device encode individual comb modes, enabling broadband, mode-resolved spectral acquisition without relying on coherent detection. This architecture supports measurements through highly scattering media and from non-cooperative targets while retaining the core advantages of frequency-comb spectroscopy. Our method achieves picometer-level spectral resolution, a 10-nm (1.27-THz) instantaneous bandwidth, single-photon sensitivity down to 10^-4 photons per pulse, and compressed spectral acquisition with 2.5% sampling for <10% reconstruction error. These capabilities establish a powerful platform for diverse gas-sensing applications, including remote environmental monitoring, industrial leak localization, and explosive-threat detection."}

Here we propose theoretically and illustrate experimentally a different approach to the construction of HOTIs. This approach utilizes lattices with incomplete unit cells and achieves localized modes of topological origin across a broader parameter space. When truncation disrupts translational symmetry by cutting through the interior of multiple unit cells, boundary modes in our system emerge for both trivial and topologically nontrivial positions of the Wannier centers. We link these modes to the appearance of fractional Wannier centers. We also demonstrate that linear boundary states give rise to rich families of stable solitons bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity. Multiple types of thresholdless topological solitons with different internal symmetries are observed in waveguide arrays with triangular configurations featuring incomplete unit cells for any dimerization of waveguide spacings. Our results expand the family of HOTIs and pave the way for the observation of boundary states with different symmetries."}

We demonstrate an all-optical terahertz (THz) attoclock that reconstructs electron dynamics during photoionization by detecting THz radiation emitted from gases ionized by the fundamental and second harmonic two-color laser fields, without the need for photoelectron detection. The polarization direction of the emitted THz field reflects the direction of the photoelectron drift velocity and thus encodes the effective delay. By measuring the THz waves from argon atoms ionized by the two-color fields, and by precisely controlling their relative phase and ellipticity, we observe intensity-dependent rotations of the THz polarization direction. Both experiment and time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulations reveal that the effective delay extracted from the THz polarization direction decreases with increasing laser intensity, consistent with conventional photoelectron attoclock results. Our experiment establishes the feasibility of the THz attoclock as a contactless probe of tunneling dynamics, with promising applications to condensed matter systems where photoelectron detection is impractical."}

Electro-optic modulators implemented after the laser offer fast frequency tunability but these components are bulky and prone to high insertion losses. Here, we introduce an external cavity semiconductor laser that achieves ultrafast frequency and amplitude tunability within a compact footprint without any moving parts.
