Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable OAM beam generator from\na simple microring resonator without requiring grating-like nanostructures. Our\napproach harnesses Brillouin interaction between confined phonon and optical\nmodes, where the acoustic field is excited through microwave input. The phonon\nstimulate the conversion from a guided optical mode into a free-space vortex\nbeam. Under the selection rule of radiation, the OAM order of the emitted light\nis determined by the acousto-optic phase matching and is rapidly reconfigurable\nby simply tuning the microwave frequency. Furthermore, this all-microwave\ncontrol scheme allows for the synthesis of arbitrary high-dimensional OAM\nsuperposition states by programming the amplitudes and phases of the driving\nfields. Analytical and numerical models predict a radiation efficiency over\n25\\% for experimentally feasible on-chip microcavities. This work introduces a\nnovel paradigm for chip-to-free-space interfaces, replacing fixed nanophotonic\nstructures with programmable acousto-optic interactions for versatile\nstructured light generation."}

In this\ncontext, the modulation of the local refractive index can be exploited to\ncustomize an effective reflectivity by the use of distributed Bragg mirrors,\nenabling the on-chip integration of Fabry-P\\'erot resonators. The resulting\ncavity length is strongly wavelength-dependent, offering practical solutions to\nthe growing demand of dispersion engineering. Owing to their typically high\ncore-to-cladding refractive index contrast and exceptional nonlinear\nproperties, III-V semiconductor-based platforms represent promising candidates\nfor the fabrication of Bragg reflectors. In this work, we propose an\nAlGaAs-on-insulator linear resonator based on distributed Bragg mirrors.

However, a quantitative\nanswer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams\nactually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially\nin the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the\nfirst systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND\nbeams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic\ngenerator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu)\nunder the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair\ncomparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture.\nThrough extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage\nregime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible\nlink-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a\npowerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive\naverage gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of\noutperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is\nstrongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness\nagainst large blockers. These findings provide not just a practical roadmap for\njudiciously employing ND beams but also a clear motivation for future work in\nenvironment-aware, adaptively shaped structured beams."}
