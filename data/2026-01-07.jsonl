Meyer"], "title": "The Nucleon Axial Form Factor from Averaging Lattice QCD Results", "comment": "22 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "Flagship neutrino oscillation experiments depend on precise and accurate theoretical knowledge of neutrino-nucleon cross sections across a variety of energies and interaction mechanisms. Key ingredients to the amplitudes that make up these cross sections are parameterized form factors. The axial form factor describing a weak interaction with a nucleon is part of one of the primary neutrino-nucleon interaction mechanisms, quasielastic scattering, yet this form factor is uncertain and its precision is limited by the availability of data for a neutrino scattering with nucleons or small nuclear targets. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) now offers another approach for obtaining mathematically rigorous constraints of the axial form factor from theoretical calculations with complete systematic error budgets. In this work, strategies for averaging LQCD results are explored, including both a random sampling of form factor values across momentum transfers as well as an averaging strategy based on analytic calculations of form factor derivatives. Fits to z expansion parameterizations are reported and compared against neutrino-hydrogen and neutrino-deuterium scattering data."}

We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $ν= 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model. In addition, we also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) criticality of the 2D classical $O(2)$ model by extracting the helicity modulus from the twisted partition functions, and we obtain the BKT transition temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{BKT}}=0.8928(2)$."}

Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) offers high precision, yet the 2pi ambiguity of the wrapped phase means that conventional absolute phase recovery typically relies on multiple coded patterns, sacrificing temporal resolution. Deep learning-based composite FPP (CFPP) shows promise for single-shot phase recovery from a composite fringe, but limited interpretability makes it difficult to assess reconstruction reliability or trace error sources in the absence of ground truth. To address this, we propose HSURE-CFPP (Heteroscedastic Snapshot-ensemble Uncertainty-aware Ratio Estimation for CFPP). HSURE-CFPP predicts the numerator-denominator ratio used for wrapped-phase computation with a heteroscedastic snapshot-ensemble network, enabling ultra-fast 3D imaging from a single composite fringe and producing pixel-wise uncertainty maps for confidence assessment and unreliable-region identification. Specifically, a heteroscedastic likelihood jointly estimates pixel-wise noise variance to capture data uncertainty, while a snapshot ensemble quantifies model uncertainty via dispersion across snapshots, yielding total predictive uncertainty as an interpretable reliability measure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes demonstrate that HSURE-CFPP achieves high-accuracy reconstruction at high speed and that the predicted uncertainty correlates well with reconstruction errors, providing a deployable quality-assessment mechanism for deep-learning-based FPP."}

Here, we demonstrate that first-order quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) supported by a freestanding metasurface provide exceptionally strong surface field enhancement, enabling efficient coupling with a tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer. Triangular-lattice polymer patterns on silicon nitride membranes are fabricated to realize these higher-order modes. Simulations reveal that first-order quasi-BICs exhibit much stronger field enhancement than zeroth-order modes at the top surface where the WS2 monolayer is placed. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements confirm a remarkable PL enhancement factor of 127 for first-order quasi-BICs, over six times larger than that of zeroth-order quasi-BICs. These results establish higher-order BICs in freestanding metasurfaces as a powerful route to engineer light-matter interactions in 2D semiconductors for advanced nanophotonic and quantum photonic applications."}

However, their luminescent performance deteriorates sharply at high temperatures. Herein, a serials of Mg2GeO4:Ti4+,Ln3+ (Ln = Tb, Eu) phosphors demonstrated anomalous thermal quenching PersL due to the temperature-dependent Fermi-Dirac distribution of bound charge carriers of Ti4+Mg2+ as remote electron traps and VMg2+ as hole traps. The high carrier retention rate of phosphors is attributed to the ability of Ti4+Mg2+ positive charge center to strongly trap non-bonding electrons over a long range (about 20 angstroms) as the electronic satellite for its stable operation. Under external optical/thermal stimulation, the released electrons and holes recombine at the different luminescent levels of Tb3+, resulting in the emission of different PersL branching ratios. Using these phosphors, we have developed 5D optical data storage (2D plane + trap depth + temperature + time) and the encrypted engine program for high-temperature aerospace engines. This study reveals the energy storage process of long-range trapping and releasing electrons by Ti4+ electron traps, and provides a new design concept for the design of PersL materials."}

Contrary to the principle of symmetry inheritance in free-space optics, where the symmetry of any structured field is strictly constrained by that of its source, we show that strong SOI enables quasi-symmetry-protected formation of meron lattices even when the underlying optical sources violate the nominal rotational symmetry. By analyzing the Hermiticity of the electric-dipole radiation amplitude in a circular polarization basis, we derive an effective mirror operator acting only on a subset of C3 polarized dipole emitters, forming a quasi-symmetry group that commutes with SOI. This quasi-symmetry guarantees exact C3 merons and gives rise to a robust polarization zone within which continuously varying input polarizations generate identical topological textures. Our work establishes quasi-symmetry as a new fundamental principle in optical physics and opens pathways to engineered topological structures of light beyond conventional symmetry constraints."}

Lithium niobate combines low optical loss, strong piezoelectricity, high intrinsic fQ_m factor, and low thermal conductivity, making it promising for exploring optomechanical platforms targeting thermal sensing applications. Here, we developed an integrated optomechanical platform on thin-film lithium niobate with precisely engineered optical, mechanical, and thermal fields within a compact 40 μm by 40 μm footprint. The platform integrates suspended microring resonators with ultrathin central membranes, reducing mechanical stiffness and effective mass while maintaining a high optical factor Q_o of 1e6 and mechanical quality factor Q_m of 1117, which increases to 5.1e4 after oscillation. The design suppresses thermal dissipation into the silicon substrate and enhances thermal sensitivity, achieving a temperature coefficient of frequency of -124 ppm/K and a noise-equivalent power of 6.2 nW/sqrt(Hz) at 10 kHz at room temperature. This compact and scalable platform opens up new opportunities for high-sensitivity thermal sensing, supports heterogeneous integration with infrared absorbers for uncooled infrared detection, and enables fully integrated, all-optical on-chip readout, paving the way toward large-format, low-noise infrared sensing arrays."}

The central hurdle remains the inherent compromise between color saturation and cooling power. Inspired by organisms such as butterflies, which decouple structural color from thermal function, we present a smart textile that seamlessly merges a dynamic thermochromic layer with static photonic crystals (PCs). This design enables the solar reflectance to be autonomously switched-from approximately 0.6 in the colored state for heating to about 0.9 in the high-reflectance state for cooling. Consequently, outdoor experiments validated substantial temperature regulation: the fabric achieves a surface temperature reduction of 3-4 °C in summer and a heating difference of <1 °C in winter compared to commercial reference materials, all while maintaining high-saturation colors. This dual-mode operation offers a viable pathway for achieving adaptive, aesthetic, and energy-free thermal comfort."}

This study presents a 1550 nm vehicle-portable ultra-stable laser designed for continuous real-time operation on highways. We implement several measures to mitigate environmental impacts, including active temperature control with a standard deviation of mK/day to reduce frequency drift of the optical reference cavity, all-polarization-maintaining fiber devices to enhance the robustness of the optical path, and highly integrated electronic units to diminish thermal effects. The performance of the ultra-stable laser is evaluated through real-time beat frequency measurements with another similar ultra-stable laser over a transport distance of approximately 100 km, encompassing rural roads, national roads, urban roads, and expressways. The results indicate frequency stability of approximately 10-12/(0.01s-100 s) during transport, about 5E-14/s while the vehicle is stationary with the engine running, and around 3E-15/s with the engine off, all without active vibration isolation.

While single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are recognized for their gas adsorption capabilities, their integration with photonic structures often overlooks complex light-matter interactions. In this work, we report a counterintuitive polarization-dependent response in an evanescent-wave NO2 sensor, fabricated by depositing aerosol-synthesized SWCNT thin films onto SPFs. The device demonstrates high performance, including a limit of detection of 400 ppb and stable operation in humid environments. However, its sensing behavior deviates strikingly from established models: upon NO2 exposure, transmitted light intensity increases for TM polarization but decreases for TE polarization, a phenomenon not attributable solely to changes in the intrinsic absorption of the SWCNTs. We pinpoint that the dominant mechanism is a gas-induced alteration of the SWCNT film's complex refractive index, which subsequently perturbs the evanescent field mode profile of the waveguide. Numerical simulations confirm that accounting for this mode-profile redistribution is essential to accurately describe the sensor's response. Revealed mechanism provides an important design framework for advanced evanescent-field sensors based on tunable nanomaterial claddings."}

This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED."}
