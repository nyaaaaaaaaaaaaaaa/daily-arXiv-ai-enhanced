Despite recent progress in\nthe development of negative-index metamaterials, losses continue to be a\nsignificant barrier to realizing optical antimatter. In this work, we show that\npassive, lossy materials can be used to realize optical antimatter when\nilluminated by light at a complex frequency. We further establish that one can\nengineer arbitrary complex-valued permittivity and permeability in such\nmaterials. Strikingly, we show that materials with a positive index at real\nfrequencies can act as negative-index materials under complex frequency\nexcitation. Using our approach, we numerically demonstrate the optical\nantimatter functionality, as well as double focusing by an ideal perfect lens\nand superscattering. Our work demonstrates the power of temporally structured\nlight in unlocking the promising opportunities of complementary media, which\nhave until now been inhibited by material loss."}

Here, we identify these\nfeatures as interference-induced resonances, effective electromagnetic modes\nwith complex, non-Hermitian couplings to quantum emitters. We show that these\nmodes hybridize with emitters to form polaritons even when the system\nparameters do not satisfy the single-mode strong-coupling criterion. Moreover,\nthe resulting polaritons differ in their decay rates, a phenomenon we term\nimaginary Rabi splitting. Extending the analysis to ensembles, we find that\ncoupling to interference-induced resonances produces long-lived polaritons that\ncan outlast excitonic dark states. Numerical simulations of a realistic hybrid\nmetallodielectric platform confirm these predictions and demonstrate their\nrobustness against disorder and loss.

Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for\nthe multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission\nspectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are\ngenerally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid\nnanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is\nnecessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to\nshowcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal\nposition of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the\nsufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism\ncan explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference,\nincluding lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and\nquasi-bound states in the continuum.

Metasurface-based platforms offer unique advantages\nbecause of their compact design, energy efficiency, and the ability to\nprecisely manipulate light at the subwavelength scale, in a contact-less\nfashion. However, achieving both high transmission modulation and low optical\nloss in the telecom band remains a challenge. This study develops monolithic\nand hybrid metasurfaces based on the phase change material antimony trisulfide\n(Sb$_2$S$_3$) to address this limitation. First, we demonstrate the capability\nof Sb$_2$S$_3$ to offer up to ~91 percent modulation, even with a magnetic\ndipole - a low-Q resonance. It lifts the requirement for complex precisely\nfabricated metasurfaces, a long-standing limitation in the community for all\noptical switching. Furthermore, with the most straightforward hybridisation\napproach, i.e. depositing a thin film of silicon, we improved the simulated\nmodulation depth to 99 percent. Experimentally, over 80 percent modulation was\nachieved for both hybrid and monolithic structures, with nearly 2-fold less\npower required for switching in the hybrid design whilst maintaining high\nmodulation depth. This performance results from the significant refractive\nindex tunability of Sb$_2$S$_3$ and its intrinsically low optical loss (k <\n10^{-4}) in the telecom band, further enhanced by silicon integration. The\ndemonstrated metasurfaces offer an effective and scalable approach for\nall-optical light modulation with strong potential for integration into\nCMOS-compatible photonic circuits and next-generation telecommunications\nsystems."}

To address this\nchallenge, we demonstrate an ultrafast intra-cavity optical gating scheme in a\nhigh-finesse, second-order nonlinear microcavity incorporating a thin-film of\nlithium niobate. A femtosecond optical gate pulse -- tuned to the transparency\nregion of the cavity's dielectric mirrors -- achieves instantaneous\nup-conversion of the intra-cavity field via sum-frequency generation. The\nresulting upconverted signal exits the cavity as a short pulse, providing\nspace- and time-resolved, on-demand access to the intra-cavity state. We\nvalidate this approach by tracking the dynamics of multiple resonant modes\nexcited in a plano-concave distributed Bragg reflector microcavity, showing\nclose agreement with analytical models.
