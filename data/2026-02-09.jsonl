In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling. A versatile platform for producing high-aspect-ratio nanochannels that are optically accessible and fluidically functional is presented, thereby expanding opportunities for advanced applications."}

Main text (20 pages, 6 figures) followed by Supplementary Information (12 pages, 6 figures, starting on page 21)", "summary": "Broadband and continuous frequency tuning is central to the versatility of semiconductor lasers, yet existing approaches typically rely on external moving components, limiting scalability and integration. Here we demonstrate broadband continuous frequency tuning in a non-Hermitian laser array achieved solely by controlling the pump currents. We show that in two coupled sub-lasers with frequency detuning ($Δω$) and relative loss ($Δα$), a mode-switching boundary emerges in the ($Δω$, $Δα$) parameter space, shaping the frequency landscape of the lower-loss supermode. The topology of this boundary comprises pseudo-symmetric (PS) and pseudo-symmetry-broken (PSB) branches connected at an exceptional point (EP). When tuning trajectories cross the PS branch, frequency tuning is discontinuous, whereas trajectories crossing the PSB branch enable continuous tuning; trajectories through the EP yield the maximum continuous tuning range. Experiments using two coupled terahertz quantum cascade lasers demonstrate continuous tuning over 10 GHz, enabled by arbitrarily many combinations of pump currents. Extending this approach to a multi-element array further expands the continuous tuning range to 163 GHz. These results establish a general route to broadband continuous tuning in moving-part-free semiconductor lasers and highlight the potential for dynamic eigenvalue engineering in non-Hermitian photonics and beyond."}

Local models, while commonly employed, quickly become infeasible for complex and locally coupled structures. Conventional iterative optimization techniques, on the other hand, are computationally intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to convergence in local minima. This study explores a versatile generative methodology based on enhanced posterior sampling within the Schrödinger Bridge framework. By decomposing posterior sampling into amplitude and directional contributions, we effectively integrated different kind of posterior sampling. This approach is further supported by refined training strategies to enhance performance and reduce the complexity of hyperparameter optimization. The proposed framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness, representing a significant advancement in metasurface design. Notably, it enables high-precision inverse design for large-scale configurations of up to $350 \\times 350$ pillar arrays, despite being trained on significantly smaller arrays of $23 \\times 23$ pillars."}

A multi-pumped DKS enables either all-optical trapping in the Kerr-induced synchronization regime, or a multi-component OFC with \\greg{a locked repetition rate yet with constant frequency offsets between the components} in the multi-color DKS regime. The multi-color DKS regime is of particular interest since nonlinear mixing between the DKS and the secondary pumped component generates idler waves at different frequencies that are useful for spectral extension of the DKS comb. Here, we explore multi-color idler generation at frequencies in which the resonator free spectral range matches that at the DKS. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that without phase matching, the idler forms a bright pulse fundamentally bound to the bright DKS through parametric interaction, despite occurring in normal dispersion. Our work can enable new applications in metrology and spectroscopy of quantum systems toward visible wavelengths, as the parametric nature of our bright-bright state eliminates dependence on dispersion regime or visible wavelength pumping."}

Here, we employed thermoelastic surface acoustic waves (SAW) in a 8 dB/m propagation loss $\\rm{Si_3N_4}$ integrated circuits without adding extra materials. A phase modulation efficiency enhancement of 13.6 dB is realized with a multi-pass configuration. Furthermore, a single-sideband intermodal scattering with a suppression ratio of 8 dB is measured and an intensity modulation is observed by incorporating the phase modulation into a ring resonator spectral. This thermoelastic SAW technique, as an initial step of acousto-optic modulation in low-loss $\\rm{Si_3N_4}$ platform, is promising for integrated microwave photonics and programmable photonics applications."}

HOTIs of the Wannier type cam be extended into the nonlinear regime. Another prominent class of HOTIs, in the form of multipole insulators, was investigated only in the linear regime, due to the challenge of simultaneously achieving both negative hopping and strong nonlinearity. Here we propose the concept of nonlinear quadrupole topological insulators (NLQTIs) and report their experimental realization in an electric circuit lattice. Quench-initiated dynamics gives rise to nonlinear topological corner states and topologically trivial corner solitons, in weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes, respectively. Furthermore, we reveal the formation of two distinct types of bulk solitons, one existing in the middle finite gap under the action of weak nonlinearity, and another one found in the semi-infinite gap under strong nonlinearity. This work realizes another member of the nonlinear HOTI family, suggesting directions for exploring novel solitons across a broad range of topological insulators."}

Menyuk", "Grégory Moille"], "title": "Dissipative Kerr Soliton Self-Balancing from Kerr-Induced Synchronization", "comment": null, "summary": "Integrated frequency comb sources are a key enabling technology for frequency metrology applications. Their on-chip integration promises to bring metrology capacity outside of the lab, particularly since they can operate at low continuous-wave pump laser power in the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime. Yet, such small foot-print and low power comes at a cost: higher noise and overall lower comb power. In particular, this translates to highly challenging detection and locking of the carrier-envelope offset, necessary for complete stabilization of the comb. Recently, Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) of a DKS to a reference laser has been demonstrated as a tool for passive all-optical stabilization of DKS microcombs, with fundamental modification to the DKS and microcomb properties. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of additional power from the reference laser (now part of the DKS) and the KIS phase locking that pins the repetition rate together fundamentally alter the DKS, forcing an energy redistribution to maintain its center of mass. We demonstrate this self-balancing effect theoretically, which in a pure quadratic dispersion resonator leads to reference-dependent recoil. With higher-order dispersion through which the DKS yields phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), we demonstrate that self-balancing increases the DW radiation, experimentally showing a 22 dB increase of comb teeth at 780 nm in an octave-spanning microcomb for efficient deployable carrier-envelope offset detection."}
