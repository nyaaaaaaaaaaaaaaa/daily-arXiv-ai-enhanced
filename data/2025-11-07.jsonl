Among these applications, designing on-chip\nspectrometers for RF spectrum analysis is particularly challenging since it\nrequires combining high resolution and large bandwidth with a fast update rate.\nExisting chip-scale spectrometers cannot achieve the resolution required for RF\nanalysis, setting aside challenges in maintaining a fast update rate and broad\nbandwidth. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a silicon\nphotonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based RF spectrum analyzer that combines an\nultra-high-resolution speckle spectrometer with an interferometric\nRF-to-optical encoding scheme. The PIC-based speckle spectrometer uses a\npath-mismatched multimode interferometer with inverse designed splitters to\ncompensate for waveguide loss, enabling a record-high resolution of 100 MHz\n(0.8 pm at a wavelength of 1550 nm). To further improve the resolution of the\noverall RF spectrum analyzer, we modify the RF-to-optical encoding scheme by\ndirecting the RF signal through a path mismatched interferometer and encoding\nthe outputs of the RF interferometer on separate optical carriers. This further\nreduces the RF spectral correlation width of the combined system, enabling the\nRF spectrum analyzer to resolve RF tones separated by 10 MHz across a bandwidth\nof 10 GHz. Since this approach operates as a single-shot spectrometer, it can\nsupport fast update rates, providing a path to compact, persistent wideband RF\nspectrum analysis."}
