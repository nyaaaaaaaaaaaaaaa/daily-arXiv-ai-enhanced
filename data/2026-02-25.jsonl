Interfaces with abrupt changes in the material properties significantly impede wave transmission, leading to reflections. This limitation, known as impedance mismatch, becomes even more prominent for mode conversion between different wave types due to polarization mismatch. In this study, we investigate a mechanism employing two-dimensional functionally graded anisotropic metamaterials to facilitate longitudinal--shear mode conversion as waves propagate from a stiff to a compliant medium. By embedding density and anisotropic shape gradients within the functionally graded metamaterial, polarization-induced impedance mismatch is mitigated and efficient mode conversion is enabled. We use unit cell dispersion analysis to tailor the frequency range for mode conversion through gradation in the dispersion behavior and coupling between modes. Using frequency-domain finite element analysis, we demonstrate broadband mode conversion across interfaces with large stiffness contrast operating in the 1--10 kHz range. We then experimentally validate and quantify mode conversion through full-field velocity measurements on an additively manufactured specimen. We further apply the methodology to design a device capable of converting radial--tangential wave modes."}

However, the absence of a scalable poling method for EO polymers, combined with the slow switching speeds characteristic of liquid crystals, has impeded the integration and compatibility of these materials with commercial silicon photonic foundries. On the other hand, the realization of very-large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the native silicon photonics platform itself is impeded by the complexities associated with the wavelength and thermal stabilization for microring modulators (MRMs). This study establishes the foundation for a poling-free, CMOS-compatible SOH MRM platform by exploiting simultaneous AC phase shifts in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FN-LCs). We present the first demonstration of an MRM coated with FN-LC, with both the RF signal and the DC bias applied to the same electrodes, taking advantage of the dual phase shift uniquely available in FN-LC.

Includes Supplementary Information (separate file)", "summary": "Halide perovskite quantum dots exhibit cooperative optical phenomena that are absent in conventional semiconductor nanocrystals, including exciton superradiance, superabsorption, and biexciton superradiance within individual dots. Here we develop a microscopic theory that identifies the physical origin of these Dicke effects and establishes how they can be controlled by materials parameters. The central result is that cooperative emission emerges from a competition between collective coupling of optical transition dipoles and lattice-induced disorder, with the balance governed by the Raman-derived phonon spectral density and the excitonic oscillator strength. At elevated temperature, strong Fröhlich coupling and glassy lattice dynamics produce dynamic disorder that suppresses dipole synchronization and yields incoherent emission. Upon cooling, lattice fluctuations freeze and cooperative coherence emerges when the collective coupling exceeds residual static disorder, defining size- and composition-dependent crossover temperatures that we map as phase diagrams. Extending the framework to biexcitons, we show that a confined biexciton constitutes a single correlated charge distribution dressed by a shared lattice configuration, enabling pathway-indistinguishable decay and cooperative radiative enhancement. The theory quantitatively accounts for observed size, composition, and temperature trends in radiative-rate constant ratios and biexciton binding energies, while explaining why full Dicke saturation is not universal. More broadly, the results establish Raman spectral weight and oscillator strength as design parameters for engineering cooperative quantum-optical behavior in quantum materials."}

However, achieving this dual control has remained a significant experimental challenge, often limited by the stochastic arrangement of emitter assemblies and spatially non-uniform electromagnetic fields in conventional photonic platforms. In this work, we demonstrate a unified architecture that achieves this synergy by combining the structural precision of DNA nanotechnology with the unique field environment generated by epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Using DNA molecular beacons as programmable emitter scaffolds, we establish fixed donor-acceptor separations and emitter orientations (Atto425/Cy3.5) in two well-defined conformational states: closed hairpin (emitter separation 2 nm), and open extended (7.2 nm) configurations. These structures are then embedded in the near-field of a multilayer ENZ metamaterial substrate, which facilitates spatially uniform, enhanced electromagnetic field coupling. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements demonstrate a significant increase in FRET efficiency for DNA-programmed emitter pairs in the ENZ environment, compared to those on a glass substrate, corresponding to increased donor quenching and shortened donor lifetime. These results establish a scalable experimental pathway for engineering light-matter interactions at molecular scales, enabled by the structural precision of DNA paired with ENZ mediated redistribution of the local density of optical states (LDOS) to amplify near-filed coupling between quantum emitters, with applications in next-generation bio-sensing and quantum photonic technologies."}

This exploratory calculation is performed using a leading-order pionless effective field theory of two nucleons in a finite 3D spatial volume, where the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly for moderate volumes. By considering a range of couplings where the theory supports a deuteron-like bound state, we determine the finite-volume spectra and matrix elements of the conserved local vector current. Using the Lüscher formalism, we constrain the infinite-volume, purely hadronic amplitude for this theory. Using previously derived formalism, we then map the finite-volume matrix elements to scattering amplitudes describing a reaction coupling two-particle states via a current insertion, $\\2+\\Jc \\to \\2$. We then use a recently derived relation between this class of amplitudes and the bound-state elastic form factor to directly constrain the infinite-volume form factor. By varying over a range of values of the coupling of the theory, we explore the effects of this analysis for deep-bound states and shallow-bound states. We reproduce the expected result that for deep bound states, the finite-volume formalism is largely unnecessary, while for shallow bound states, it is absolutely critical to obtain a sensible result. We present a detailed outline of the analysis of this class of matrix elements, including the determination of the charge radius of the bound state. In the shallow bound state limit, we find good agreement with the prediction stemming from the anomalous threshold."}

The method preserves conventional imperative, in-place implementations and enables a single-source workflow in which forces are generated directly from the action code while inheriting compiler optimizations. We perform end-to-end reverse-mode differentiation of both gauge and Wilson fermion actions. For the Wilson fermion case, we find that the force generated by automatic differentiation achieves performance comparable to a conventional hand-written fermion force implementation. The same differentiation pipeline targets both CPU and GPU backends, providing a practical route to performance-portable force construction for compositional lattice actions."}

Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point, we investigated the importance of local tetraquark operators for the $T_{cc}$ spectrum by adding them to a large basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators. We performed this calculation using the distillation framework combined with a position-space sampling method that we recently developed. This method makes local tetraquark operators affordable in distillation. Upon including local tetraquark operators, we observe significant shifts in the estimates of several energy levels.

However, their utility is fundamentally constrained by mode mixing, which renders image transmission spatially disrupted and sensitive to external perturbations. Current imaging methods typically rely on transmission matrix measurement or deep learning models that are fragile to fiber movement, necessitating frequent, time-consuming calibrations and re-calibrations that are easily disrupted and fail to generalize across different fiber configurations, let alone across entirely distinct fibers. Here, we propose a calibration and feedback-free MMF coherent imaging paradigm, that we termed Spatial Harmonic Invariant Nonlinear Encoding (SHINE). By leveraging the angle-dependent phase-matching conditions of second-harmonic generation, we encode spatial features into broadband spectral signatures that possess intrinsic insensitivity not only to modal scrambling but also to fiber bending, movement, as well as structural variations. This spectral representation enables a deep learning model to robustly reconstruct images in real time despite dynamic perturbations and even generalizes well to distinct MMFs without recalibration or feedback. We achieve experimentally an average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.82 for image reconstruction tasks on Fashion-MNIST and a classification accuracy of 92.3% on HERLEV biomedical dataset. Uniquely, our method exhibits remarkable cross-fiber generalization: a model trained on a single MMF successfully reconstructs images transmitted through entirely distinct, previously unseen MMFs with a PCC of 0.74. These results establish a robust, calibration-free framework for imaging through MMFs in real time, paving the way for practical, resilient optical diagnostics that operate without distal-end feedback."}

Our study is carried out within lattice simulation in the comoving reference frame of accelerated observer which is parameterized by the Rindler coordinates. We find that finite temperature confinement-deconfinement phase transition turns into spatial crossover in the Rindler spacetime. In other words, spatially separated confinement and deconfinement phases can coexist in the Rindler spacetime within certain intervals of temperature and acceleration. We determine the position of the boundary between the phases as a function of temperature for several accelerations and find that it can be described by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law with rather good accuracy although a minor deviation takes place. Moreover, the critical temperature of the system in the weak acceleration regime is found to remain unchanged as that of the standard homogeneous gluodynamics. Our results imply that the spatial confinement-deconfinement transition might take place in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole horizon."}

By injecting an auxiliary laser to anchor one of the microcomb lines, we create a potential well to trap and steer the soliton. Thus, soliton timing can be engineered by phase modulating the injected laser. Theory and measurement reveal the fast response bandwidth of the OTEM, which enabled a soliton slew rate of 31.3 ps/$μ$s, surpassing existing time-programmable fiber laser combs by more than two orders of magnitude. Leveraging the timing scan, we used a single OTEM for single-pixel and parallel ranging by retrieving the phase of the multi-heterodyne beat spectrum.

In this work, a compact BIC design method based on optical conformal mapping is proposed, where a conventionally infinite periodic structure extended along one direction is mapped into a finite-sized annular structure. This symmetry transition, i.e., from translational to rotational, enables structural miniaturization while fully preserving the eigenvalues and BIC type of the original system. These transformations require only the adjustment of background permittivity and source distribution, without introducing extreme material parameters. As a concrete example, we show through theoretical and numerical analysis that a transformed compact all-dielectric structure, consisting of a double annular dielectric grating embedded in a gradient-index dielectric background, can support true BICs in a finite region.

Going beyond the Chern-number-based paradigms, quantized transports can also arise from k-direction quasienergy winding unique to periodically driven (Floquet) systems, which are free of dimensionality and adiabaticity limitations. However, lattices displaying winding of their quasienergy bands require asymmetric long-range couplings that are difficult to achieve in lattices of real-space coupled sites. Here, by leveraging photonic synthetic dimensions we construct asymmetric long-range-couplings in a one-dimensional temporal quantum walk based on three coupled fiber loops. We demonstrate quantized transport arising from the winding of quasienergy bands in k direction. We show that the average group velocity of an initial wave packet is proportional to the winding number, which leads to a quantized transport displacement. To better visualize this quantized displacement, we cascade two regions with flipped nearest/long-range couplings and observe a focusing effect with a quantized spatial shift in the focusing point. We also probe the robust properties of quantized transport against obstacles and disorders.

Therefore, closed-loop control with integrated displacement sensing is essential for 3D nano-printed optical microsystems in practical precision positioning applications. Here, we present a closed-loop control system for a such a lens actuator that uses a commercial 3-axis Hall sensor for position tracking. A NdFeB micromagnet encircling the integrated microlens provides both the actuation force and a position-dependent sensing signal. The Hall sensor, located between an anti-Helmholtz-like coil pair that drives the scanner bidirectionally, measures the combined field due to the micro-magnet and the coil pair. Calibration-based subtraction separates the coil field and sensor offset contributions to recover the magnet field and thus the axial magnet displacement. Closed-loop operation yields a mean absolute accuracy of 0.86 um and a precision of 0.49 um over a displacement range of 150 um while eliminating viscoelastic creep, suppressing hysteresis, and minimizing temperature-induced displacement drift under coil self-heating.

However, experimental approaches achieving this simultaneous resolution remain scarce and instrumentally demanding.\n  While near-field probing offers promising platforms to combine ultrafast and nanometer resolution, a major challenge is the observation of in-plane propagation dynamics, required for studying many application-relevant, high-speed phenomena from carrier transport in 2D materials to spin-to-charge conversion in spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs). However, near-field scanning probes are primarily sensitive to out-of-plane electric fields.\n  Here we present a solution to this challenge by performing terahertz (THz) emission nanoscopy (TEN) of a photoexcited fiber-coupled STE using a scanning-probe microscope. We uncover a counterintuitive, dipolar evolution of the near-field THz signal, which we show originates from the scanning-probe's inherent sensitivity to local out-of-plane electric fields that emerge in our case from spatially confined in-plane charge currents. Our findings resolve ambiguities regarding the sensitivity of near-field probes to ultrafast in-plane charge transport and establish TEN as a fully vectorial probe for the spatiotemporal imaging of coupled nanoscale THz charge and spin dynamics."}

Its capability to measure the doping of semiconductors is well known, yet the exact doping ranges that are accessible to terahertz spectroscopy are not obvious. Therefore, we introduce a sensitivity metric to clarify whether a semiconductor sample can be characterized in principle by reflection terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. This quantity takes into account the semiconductor material with a certain layer thickness, doping type, and doping level and is based on numerical simulations. In this work, we calculate this sensitivity value for relevant semiconductor materials (SiC, Si, GaN) in realistic layer stacks with up to three layers. It is used to create meaningful heat maps depending on the thicknesses and charge carrier densities of the sample structures of interest. The plausibility of the sensitivity is validated by mapping a variety of measurements with terahertz techniques from us and from other groups onto these heat maps. Based on these, the accessible range of charge carrier densities for terahertz spectroscopy spans roughly from 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ to 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, but with dependencies on material, doping type, and sample thickness. Furthermore, the sensitivity value allows for a substantiated assessment of the possible benefits future improvements of photoconductive antennas and terahertz systems could have, which is demonstrated by simulations based on varied bandwidths."}

SI: 10 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Guided acoustic waves in two-dimensional materials are a key channel for energy transport and dissipation, yet their generation and propagation in transition metal dichalcogenides remain poorly understood. Here, we employ in-situ and spatially decoupled ultra-fast optical pump-probe techniques to investigate guided waves in MoS2 flakes with thicknesses between 90 and 410 nm. We observe a propagating acoustic excitation with a constant velocity of (6.7 +/- 0.8) km/s, independent of thickness. Finite element simulations and symmetry analysis reveal that these vibrations deviate from the classical Lamb wave model and are better described as a superposition of decoupled longitudinal and shear modes. We show that their optical detectability is governed by the Poisson effect: longitudinal components modulate the flake thickness and generate a measurable signal, whereas shear motion remains largely optically invisible. An intrinsic attenuation length of approximately 3.3 microns indicates that dissipation is dominated by material-specific mechanisms rather than geometric spreading. Finally, we demonstrate remote excitation across a nanometric step, enabling acoustic generation in optically inaccessible regions. These results provide a foundation for nanoscale phononic circuits and engineered in-plane energy transport in 2D-based optomechanical and quantum acoustic devices."}
