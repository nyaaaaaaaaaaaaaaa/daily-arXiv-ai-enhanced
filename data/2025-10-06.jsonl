However, a key limitation of electro-optic combs is the restricted\nnumber of comb lines imposed by the available RF source power. To overcome this\nlimitation, a nonlinear spectral broadening stage is typically employed. The\nphase noise characteristics of an electro-optic comb are well described by the\nstandard phase noise model, which depends on two parameters: the seed laser and\nthe RF source phase noise. A fundamental question that arises is how nonlinear\nbroadening processes affect the phase noise properties of the expanded comb. To\naddress this, we employ coherent detection, digital signal processing, and\nsubspace tracking. Our experimental results show that the nonlinearly broadened\ncomb preserves the standard phase noise model of the input electro-optic comb.\nIn other words, the nonlinear processes neither introduce additional phase\nnoise terms nor amplify the existing contributions from the seed laser and RF\nsource. Hence, nonlinear broadening can be viewed as equivalent to driving the\nelectro-optic comb with a much higher RF modulation power."}

We\nanalyze the scattering of electromagnetic waves from spatially finite PTCs\nusing the multispectral Floquet scattering matrix, which naturally incorporates\nthe frequency-mixing processes intrinsic to such systems. For dispersionless,\nreal, and time-periodic permittivities, this matrix is pseudounitary. Here we\ndemonstrate that this property leads to multiple symmetry-breaking transitions:\nfor increasing driving strength, scattering matrix eigenvalues lying on the\nunit circle (unbroken symmetry regime) meet at exceptional points (EPs), where\nthey break up into inverse complex conjugate pairs (broken symmetry regime). We\nidentify the symmetry operator associated with these transitions and show that,\nin time-symmetric systems, it corresponds to the time-reversal operator.\nRemarkably, at the parametric resonance condition, one eigenvalue vanishes\nwhile its partner diverges, signifying simultaneous coherent perfect absorption\n(CPA) and lasing. Since our approach relies solely on the Floquet scattering\nmatrix, it is not restricted to a specific geometry but instead applies to any\nperiodically time-varying scattering system. To illustrate this universality,\nwe apply our method to a variety of periodically time-modulated structures,\nincluding slabs, spheres, and metasurfaces.
