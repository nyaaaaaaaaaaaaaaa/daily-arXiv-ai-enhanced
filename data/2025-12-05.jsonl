As demonstrated by numerical modelling and the decomposition of Laguerre-Gaussian modes according to the basis of orthogonal Zernike polynomials, disparities in the stability of Laguerre-Gaussian modes with differing radial and azimuthal numbers are evident. The demonstration is made of the minimization of the distortion of the transverse beam profile with an increase in the radial number."}

Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks."}

These techniques typically require high optical intensities to increase the strength of the nonlinear interactions, which can perturb native biochemistry and damage or kill living samples. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy visualizes the spatial distribution of molecules using a nonlinear interaction between light and chemically specific molecular vibrations. However, the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations is limited by the total photon dose that can be applied before photodamage alters the sample, and photon shot noise sets the minimum achievable noise floor for most microscopes. Here we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced SRS microscope that is more sensitive than an equivalent conventional SRS microscope by up to 8.3(7) dB in spectroscopy and 8.6(1) dB in cell imaging. These results approach quantum limits on sensitivity and demonstrate that quantum states of light are sufficient but not necessary to enhance the sensitivity of microscopy techniques that are limited by photodamage."}

Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers a promising non-invasive and stand-off detection technique owing to its ability to penetrate optically opaque materials without causing ionization damage. While many chemicals exhibit distinct spectral features in the terahertz range, conventional terahertz-based detection methods often struggle in real-world environments, where variations in sample geometry, thickness, and packaging can lead to inconsistent spectral responses. In this study, we present a chemical imaging system that integrates THz-TDS with deep learning to enable accurate pixel-level identification and classification of different explosives. Operating in reflection mode and enhanced with plasmonic nanoantenna arrays, our THz-TDS system achieves a peak dynamic range of 96 dB and a detection bandwidth of 4.5 THz, supporting practical, stand-off operation. By analyzing individual time-domain pulses with deep neural networks, the system exhibits strong resilience to environmental variations and sample inconsistencies. Blind testing across eight chemicals, including pharmaceutical excipients and explosive compounds, resulted in an average classification accuracy of 99.42% at the pixel level. Notably, the system maintained an average accuracy of 88.83% when detecting explosives concealed under opaque paper coverings, demonstrating its robust generalization capability. These results highlight the potential of combining advanced terahertz spectroscopy with neural networks for highly sensitive and specific chemical and explosive detection in diverse and operationally relevant scenarios."}

We develop machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms to compensate for observed WFEs, via phase retrieval, resulting in up to a 2/3 reduction in the relative phase error variance.

The results show that the forward-scattering holographic (FSH), backward-scattering holographic (BSH), and time double-slit (TDS) structures are found to be highly sensitive to the pulse duration, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and temporal envelope in the sub-cycle regime. Sub-cycle pulses with CEP values of $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ selectively enhance or suppress distinct features, isolating holographic patterns and enhancing BSH fringes. Classical analysis reveals that the intrinsic chirp inherent to sub-cycle fields shortens the recollision time for scattering trajectories, thereby increasing the fringe spacing in FSH and BSH patterns, while simultaneously enlarging the ATI peak spacing associated with TDS interference. Pulse envelope variations, even at fixed FWHM duration, further reshape the fringe spacings by modifying the instantaneous frequency and vector potential slope near ionization times. These results demonstrate that sub-cycle pulses enable precise temporal control of holographic interference, offering new opportunities for probing and manipulating attosecond electron dynamics."}

Photonic alternatives offer a promising route, yet the difficulty of realizing optical nonlinearities has prevented the realization of all-optical CNNs capable of end-to-end image classification. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical CNN that bypasses the need for explicit optical nonlinear activations. Our architecture comprises a single spatial-differentiation convolutional stage--using 24 directional kernels spanning 360°, along with a mean-filtering kernel--followed by a diffractive fully-connected layer. The directional convolution enhances feature selectivity, suppresses noise and crosstalk, and simplifies the classification task, allowing the weak nonlinearity inherent in optical diffraction to achieve high accuracy. We report experimentally classification accuracies of 86.8% on handwritten digits (MNIST) and 94.8% on a ten-class gesture dataset. The system delivers a computational throughput of 1.13X10^5 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and an energy efficiency of 1.51X10^3 TOPS/W--the highest reported among CNN hardware--with the potential to improve by a further 5-6 orders of magnitude using nanosecond-scale detectors.

Multimode fibers (MMFs) using space-division multiplexing (SDM) are promising for improved transmission capacity, connection flexibility, and security of data. However, the complex transmission characteristics of MMFs significantly hinder precise mode demultiplexing. Conventional approaches, including holographic measurements, phase retrieval algorithms, photonic lanterns, and multiplane light conversion, are limited by system complexity, size, and flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a purely optical, chip-scale AI solution for high-mode isolation, speed-of-light demultiplexing of MMF modes using a three-dimensional diffractive neural network (DNN). The DNN is trained with synthetic modal data and fabricated using two-photon nanolithography. It features a compact size of $120μm \\times 120μm \\times 80μm$ and a diffractive structure size of $1μm^{2}$ for the neurons at the hidden layers of the network. Experimentally, the DNN demultiplexer achieves a relative demultiplexing accuracy of over 80%. The AI approach of DNN allows for flexible design and overcomes the size and performance limitations of digital-optical demultiplexers.

Our method employs a motorized kinematic mirror to generate a sequence of controlled, multi-angle plane-wave illuminations, with each resulting oblique-illumination intensity image encoding a limited portion of the spatial-frequency content of the target imaging sample. These measurements are combined in the Fourier domain using an aberration-corrected iterative phase-retrieval algorithm integrated with an efficient illumination calibration scheme, which enables the reconstruction of resolution-enhanced amplitude and phase images through the synthetic expansion of the effective numerical aperture.

Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging."}

This very simple setup enhances the laser's performance in terms of threshold current and emitted power. We further prove that the EC configuration positively impacts the laser's noise properties. In particular, the intrinsic linewidth is substantially reduced, the full linewidth is also decreased (depending on the integration timescale), and the relative intensity noise is slightly reduced. These characteristics, which hold within the whole tuning range, make the EC-QCL a good candidate for spectroscopy applications where broad tunability and narrow linewidth are highly demanded."}

Advances in nanofabrication have allowed precise dispersion engineering, unlocking octave-spanning soliton combs that are essential for applications such as optical atomic clocks, frequency synthesis, precision spectroscopy, and astronomical spectrometer calibration. However, a key challenge hindering their practical deployment is the intrinsic bandwidth-efficiency trade-off: achieving broadband soliton generation requires large pump detuning, which suppresses power coupling and limits pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies to only a few percent. Recent efforts using pulsed pumping or coupled-resonator architectures have improved efficiency to several tens of percent, yet their bandwidths remain below one-tenth of an octave, inadequate for applications demanding wide spectral coverage. Here, we overcome this limitation by harnessing mode interactions between spatial modes within a single microresonator. The mode hybridization creates an additional power-transfer channel that supports large pump detuning while maintaining strong pump-to-resonator coupling, enabling broadband soliton formation at substantially reduced pump power. Using this approach, we demonstrate an octave-spanning soliton microcomb with a record pump-to-comb conversion efficiency exceeding 50%. These results resolve the fundamental bandwidth-efficiency dilemma in soliton microcombs and paves the way toward fully-integrated, high-efficiency, ultrabroad comb sources for next-generation photonic systems."}
