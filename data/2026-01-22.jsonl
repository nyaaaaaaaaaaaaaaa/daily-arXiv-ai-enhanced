First-principle lattice results on the mass spectrum of the electroweak model in a strong magnetic field", "comment": "10 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "We use numerical Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector of the electroweak model in an external magnetic field of the electroweak-scale strength ($10^{20}\\,{\\rm T}$) at zero temperature. It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions."}

At each temperature, we employ three large, fine lattices, which enables controlled continuum extrapolations of the energy-momentum tensor correlators. Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $η/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T>T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $ζ/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied."}

Datacenter. Status and Perspectives", "comment": "8 pages, 6 figures and tables", "summary": "The drastic increase of bandwidth demands in AI datacenters requires new solutions with low power consumption and high bandwidth densities. Further increasing the total bandwidth with copper interconnects is challenging, thus it is crucial to introduce optics into the scale-up network. For this purpose, the most important metrics are the energy efficiency of the total link in addition to the spatial bandwidth-density and reach. With the inefficiency of copper traces at high speeds, transitioning to co-packaged optics is no longer optional but essential. Here, we show that the mature VCSEL technology offers the ideal combination of low-cost, low-latency, high-reliability, and energy efficiency at all bitrates, thanks to their unique versatility and high wall-plug-efficiency.

Heterogeneous integration offers a potential solution to this challenge, yet practical implementations have been limited by inevitable insertion losses at material interfaces. Here, we present a self-aligned heterogeneous quantum photonic integration approach that can deterministically achieve near-unity coupling efficiency at the interface. To showcase our approach, we demonstrate Purcell enhancement of a silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond induced by a heterogeneous photonic crystal cavity defined by titanium dioxide (TiO2), as well as optical spin control and readout via a TiO2 photonic circuit. We further show that, when combined with inverse photonic design, our approach enables efficient and broadband collection of single photons from a color center into a heterogeneous waveguide. Our approach is not restricted to SiV centers or TiO2; it can be broadly applied to integrate diverse solid-state quantum emitters with thin-film photonic devices where conformal deposition is possible. Together, these results establish a practical route to scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits that combine high-quality quantum emitters with technologically mature photonic platforms."}

Morgan"], "title": "Paraxial diffusion-field retrieval. II. Fokker-Planck generalization of the transport-of-intensity equation", "comment": "36 pages, 8 figures, paper to be submitted to Physical Review A", "summary": "The transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) has been very widely employed for phase retrieval. In particular, the TIE is an elliptic second-order partial differential equation which may be solved for the phase of a coherent paraxial field such as a monochromatic scalar optical beam, given the intensity and longitudinal intensity derivative in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis. We show how the coherent flow associated with the TIE may be augmented by a diffusive flow associated with a scalar or tensor diffusion field. Such diffusive flow can arise via scattering from unresolved spatially random microstructure within an illuminated sample, the blurring effects of an extended chaotic source that illuminates the sample, the resolution-reducing effect of shot noise in detected intensity images of the sample, and the sharpening effect (negative diffusion) associated with scattering from sharp sample edges. Augmenting the TIE's modeling of coherent flow with a diffuse-flow channel leads to a Fokker-Planck extension to this equation. Two different TIE augmentations are obtained, using three different derivations. The inverse problems of phase retrieval and diffusion-field retrieval are then studied, for both defocus-based imaging and mask-based imaging (structured-illumination imaging). When symmetric overfocus and underfocus images are employed for the purposes of phase retrieval, the diffusive term drops out and our Fokker-Planck formalism implies that any ensuing TIE-based phase-retrieval method needs no modification in light of our formalism. However, the same focal-series dataset -- which is typically an infocus image, a weakly overfocused image, and a weakly underfocused image -- may also be employed to access the additional channel of information associated with the Fokker-Planck diffusion field. Our formalism is applicable to visible light, x-rays, electrons, and neutrons."}

Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution. The model successfully captures the experimental transients and yields an electron-phonon coupling constant of $1.0\\times10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}\\,K^{-1}}$, along with an electronic specific heat coefficient ranging from 1.52 to 2.02 $\\mathrm{mJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-2}}$, which allow direct prediction of the spectral switching window. Notably, we demonstrate that the Pauli blocking effect can be induced solely by a laser-excitation driven rise in electronic temperature, without requiring significant carrier injection into the conduction band in degenerate semiconductors. These findings offer new insights for designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for next-generation communication and computing technologies."}

Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting. By relying only on measured scattering parameters, this gradient-free approach is robust to experimental drift and noise and does not require complex full-wave models. Significant performance improvements over traditional simulation-based (in-silico) inverse design are demonstrated, with in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x higher isolation between ports than the best in-silico design at the same target frequency. This work also presents guidelines for applying Bayesian optimization to noisy, high-dimensional physical systems."}

We demonstrate that Kerr dressing hybridizes the optical sidebands, renormalizing the $χ^{(2)}$ couplings and detunings. As a result the system exhibits gain in regions where analogous bare $χ^{(2)}$ or $χ^{(3)}$ amplifiers are subthreshold. Time-domain Langevin simulations confirm this threshold reduction, mapping a practical design window for experiments."}

However, its use has been limited by challenges in material synthesis and in nanopatterning, owing to its chemical stability and inertness. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic electro-optic modulator entirely based on solution-deposited BaTiO$_{3}$, fabricated through a bottom-up soft nanoimprinting lithography process. Fine-tuning the synthesis and nanofabrication enhances the optical properties of the polycrystalline material.

In this work, we introduce a simplified mechanical model of STVPs, consisting of a loop of non-interacting point particles traveling at a uniform constant speed but at slightly di!erent angles. We examine di!erent initial conditions for the particle loop, including configurations that are elliptic in space at a given time and configurations that are elliptic in spacetime at a fixed propagation distance. Furthermore, employing a non-uniform mass distribution allows the particle loop to mimic the STVP not only in configuration space but also in momentum space. Remarkably, when supplemented by a semiclassical vorticity quantization condition, our mechanical model exactly reproduces di!erent wave-based OAM results previously reported for paraxial STVPs."}
