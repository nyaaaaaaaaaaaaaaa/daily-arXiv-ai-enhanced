Combining\nneural field transformations with HMC (NTHMC) can reshape the energy landscape\nand accelerate sampling, but the choice of neural architectures has yet to be\nstudied systematically. We evaluate NTHMC on a two-dimensional U(1) gauge\ntheory, analyzing how it scales and transfers to larger volumes and smaller\nlattice spacing. Controlled comparisons let us isolate architectural\ncontributions to sampling efficiency. Good designs can reduce autocorrelation\nand boost topological tunneling while maintaining favorable scaling. More\nbroadly, our study highlights emerging design guides, such as wider receptive\nfields and channel-dependent activations, paving the way for systematic\nextensions to four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory."}

This effect can\nsignificantly reduce the accuracy of background depth measurements. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a calibration-based model derived from real\nmeasurement data, introducing three physically interpretable calibration\nparameters: a normal-exposure amplitude influence coefficient, an overexposure\namplitude influence coefficient, and a scattering phase shift coefficient.\nThese parameters are used to describe the effects of foreground size, exposure\nconditions, and optical path differences on scattering interference.\nExperimental results show that the depth values calculated using the calibrated\nparameters can effectively compensate for scattering-induced errors,\nsignificantly improving background depth recovery in scenarios with complex\nforeground geometries and varying illumination conditions. This approach\nprovides a practical, low-cost solution for iToF systems, requiring no complex\nhardware modifications, and can substantially enhance measurement accuracy and\nrobustness across a wide range of real-world applications."}

In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of\nreflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the\nLinearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the\npreviously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but\neliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that\ndegrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and\nextracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and\nrepeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable\naccuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional\nmodel-based methods. Validation using more than 80 measurements on alumina\nfilms over NiFe substrates shows excellent correlation with WLI (r = 0.97) and\nlow gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R < 3%). Moreover, LRZ achieves\nan average Move-Acquire-Measure (MAM) time of approximately 2 s, which is about\n7 times faster than WLI.

Nonlinear optical processes\nin microresonators require both large quality factors to promote build-up of\nlarge intracavity powers and sufficient control over resonator dispersion to\nimplement phase-matching, which is generally achieved through careful design\nand fabrication of the resonator cross-sectional dimensions. Additionally,\ngenerating dissipative Kerr soliton optical frequency combs requires operation\nin the anomalous dispersion regime, which calls for such thick layers of SiN as\nto make achieving accuracy during etching a challenge. In this work, we\ninvestigate the relationship between fabrication process details, including\nlithography and etching, and optical properties, such as optical loss and\nresonator dispersion, for two different subtractive fabrication approaches: one\nutilizing a polymer-based electron beam resist as the protective mask during\netching and the other employing a thin metallic etch-mask. Using both\napproaches, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of polymer and metal\netch-masks, determine the origins of optical loss through variations in\nelectron beam lithography parameters, and connect resonator sidewall roughness\nto optical loss. Finally, we compare frequency comb generation in resonators\nfabricated using either approach."}

As a critical step toward\nintegrated applications, we demonstrate single-pulse AOS within a silicon\nnitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuit. Using trains of femtosecond laser\npulses guided through on-chip waveguides, we achieve deterministic toggle\nswitching in a sub-micron out-of-plane Co/Gd Hall cross patterned directly atop\nthe photonic waveguide. Electrical readout via the anomalous Hall effect\nreveals a switching contrast of up to 90% for 500 nm-wide devices. In larger\nHall crosses, the contrast decreases and switching becomes stochastic,\nconsistent with spatially non-uniform optical absorption as confirmed by\nfinite-element simulations. This behavior is hypothetically attributed to\ndomain wall relaxation and thermally assisted (de)pinning processes within\npartially switched regions.

Here, we show that similar soliton-like quantized pumping can be\nobserved in Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model by introducing a synthetic\nnonlinearity in the form of a cutoff on the coupling strengths between lattice\nsites. More importantly, we reveal that the localized excitations driving\nquantized soliton pumping are precisely the Wannier functions of the uniformly\nfilled bands of the effectively nonlinear lattice, thus restoring consistency\nwith linear Thouless pumping.
