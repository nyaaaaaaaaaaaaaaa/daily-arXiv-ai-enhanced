This study proposes a broadband tunable microwave photonic radar system that can simultaneously monitor respiration, heartbeat, and speech. The system works by generating broadband radar signals to detect subtle skin displacements caused by these physiological activities. It then utilizes phase variations in radar echo signals to extract and reconstruct the corresponding physiological signals. In order to enhance the processing capability for speech signals, a convolutional neural network with a dual-channel feature fusion model is incorporated, enabling high-precision speech recognition. In addition, the system's frequency-tunable characteristic allows it to flexibly switch frequency bands to adapt to different working environments, greatly improving its practicality and environmental adaptability. In concept-verification experiments, speech signals were reconstructed and recognized in the Ku, K, and Ka bands, achieving recognition accuracies of 97.20%, 98.07%, and 97.43%, respectively. The system's capability to detect multimodal vital signs was also thoroughly validated using a respiratory and heartbeat simulator. During a 20-second monitoring period, while accurately reconstructing speech, the maximum average error counts for respiratory and heartbeat monitoring were 0.39 and 0.87, respectively, proving its reliability and effectiveness in multimodal vital sign monitoring."}

Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations."}

In discrete lattices, however, its realization can deviate markedly from the continuous case, especially in the presence of nontrivial momentum-space band touchings. Here, we investigate angular momentum conservation associated with quadratic band-touching points (QBTPs) in two-dimensional lattices. We show that, unlike in graphene lattices hosting linear band-touching points (LBTPs), the conventional angular momentum is no longer conserved near QBTPs. Instead, we identify a generalized total angular momentum (GTAM) that remains conserved for both LBTPs and QBTPs, inherently determined by the topological winding number at the band-touching point (BTP). Using a photonic Kagome lattice, we experimentally demonstrate GTAM conservation through pseudospin-orbital angular momentum conversion. Furthermore, we show that this conservation principle extends to a broad class of discrete lattices with arbitrary pseudospin textures and higher-order winding numbers. These results reveal a fundamental link between pseudospin, angular momentum, and topology, establishing a unified framework for angular-momentum dynamics in discrete systems."}

Here, we demonstrate an on-chip quadratically nonlinear photodetector (QNPD) by configuring an InSe p-i-n homojunction on a silicon waveguide. Telecom-band light guiding in the waveguide couples with the InSe evanescently and is frequency up-converted into visible light via InSe's second-harmonic generation (SHG), which is subsequently absorbed by InSe and finally generates photocurrent under the built-in electric field of the p-i-n homojunction. Governed by these sequential processes, the on-chip QNPD presents a quadratic function between photocurrent and optical power. Thanks to the efficient SHG and well-established homojunction in InSe, the QNPD reaches a high normalized responsivity of 37.1 A/W2 and low dark current of 1 pA, representing greatly improved performances among reported nonlinear photodetectors. Benefiting from the extra SHG process, the on-chip QNPD intrinsically incorporates light-light interactions, enabling straightforwardly monitoring all-optically mixing signals electrically. As an example, an array of 16-pixel QNPDs was designed to implement a fully single-shot on-chip autocorrelator without requirement of bulky optics and external cameras, which precisely measures picosecond pulses with high sensitivity of 6.1*10-10 W2."}

Optical computing has been positioned as a new computing solution, promising high speed and energy efficiency by exploiting the available degrees of freedom of light. Although solutions exist in the optical domain, there is a continuous search for compact solutions that properly utilize the limited chip space and exploit various degrees of freedom of light. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact, programmable photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture that operates on both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom by leveraging embedded optical feedback loops. This architecture enables universal linear unitary transforms by combining resonators with passive linear mixing layers and tunable active phase layers. The strong dispersion achieved from the resonant loops enables multi-frequency operation and reduces the number of required active layers to achieve universality. This solution reduces the optical port requirements, minimizes power losses, and leverages resonances to enable massive parallel computing in the frequency domain. The fabricated samples are compatible with silicon-on-insulator platforms and operate at single- and dual-frequency modes. The experimental setup demonstrates the ability to perform in situ training in both cases, validating the parallel-computing capabilities of the PICs. This work highlights the potential of feedback-loop PICs for scalable, compact, and energy-efficient linear optical computing."}

We perform quenched lattice QCD calculations with the Coulomb gauge adopting the standard Wilson gauge action, and the spatial volume is $L^3 = 32^3$ at $β= 5.8$, which corresponds to the lattice spacing $a=0.14$ fm and the system volume $L^3=4.5^3$ fm$^3$. We evaluate the two-body color density matrix $ρ$ of static quarks, and investigate the dependence of color correlations on the quarks' spatial configuration. As a result, we find that the color correlations depend on the minimal path length along a flux tube which connects two quarks under consideration. The color correlation between quarks quenches because of color leak into the gluon field (flux tube) and finally approaches the random color configuration in the large distance limit. We find a ``universality'' in the flux-tube path length dependence of the color leak for 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q ground-state systems."}

Existing design strategies generally lack complete control over reflectionless pathways and typically require computationally intensive iterative optimization. A general analytical framework for the inverse design of arbitrary reflectionless routing has remained unavailable. Here, we present an analytical inverse-design approach based on non-Hermitian zero-index networks, which enables arbitrary reflectionless routing for nearly any desired scattering response. By establishing a direct algebraic mapping between target scattering responses and the network's physical parameters, we transform the design process from iterative optimization into deterministic calculation. This approach enables the precise engineering of arbitrary reflectionless optical routing. We demonstrate its broad utility by designing devices from unicast and multicast routers with full amplitude and phase control to coherent beam combiners and spatial mode demultiplexers in four-port and six-port networks. Our work provides a systematic and analytical route to designing advanced light-control devices."}

The total action is local on $Λ$, gauge invariant, and depends on $x$ only through Euclidean invariants built from edge vectors (local metrics, volumes, etc.), hence the partition function is exactly covariant under the global Euclidean group SE(d) at any lattice spacing. The intended symmetry-restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations; accordingly, our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.\n  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge/matter fields $(U,Φ)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $Λ$. Assuming (SR), integrating out $x$ at fixed cutoff yields a local Symanzik effective action in which geometry fluctuations generate only SO(d)-invariant irrelevant operators and finite renormalizations; in particular, in $d=4$ we recover the standard one-loop $β$-function in a scalar $φ^4$ test theory. Finally, we describe a practical local Monte Carlo update and report $d=2$ proof-of-concept simulations showing a well-behaved geometry sector and a substantial reduction of axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artifacts relative to a fixed lattice at matched bare parameters."}
