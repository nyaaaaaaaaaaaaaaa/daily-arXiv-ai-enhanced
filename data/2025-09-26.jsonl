We experimentally implement such a hybrid nanophotonic system\nand demonstrate voltage tuning of its reflectance as well as its different\npolarization-dependent behavior. Our results show that hybridization with\n2D-TMDs can serve to render resonant photonic nanostructures tunable and\ntime-variant $-$ important properties for practical applications in optical\nanalog computers and neuromorphic circuits."}

An open question is whether the ground state can counterintuitively\nsupport a flat-top, nonzero envelope, offering new opportunities for quantum\nemitters, optical antennas, and lasers. Here, we show that by applying the\nByers-Yang theorem with an artificial gauge field, energy levels can be\ncontinuously shifted, driving eigenstates to morph into a ground state with a\nuniform yet nontrivial wave envelope. We implement this concept in a photonic\ncrystal slab where a central bulk region is surrounded by heterogeneous\nbandgaps that engineer reflective phases acting as an artificial local gauge\nfield. By inducing lasing, we probe directly the evolution of the energy\nlevels, demonstrating wave morphing toward a flat-top ground state via near-\nand far-field measurements."}
