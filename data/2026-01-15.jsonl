On the inclusive side, we illustrate how to estimate the systematic uncertainties from omitted higher-order terms and non-zero smearing of the kernel approximation, building on two important features of the Chebyshev expansion. On the exclusive side, we perform BCL parameterizations of the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar form factors and compare the fitted coefficients with those from earlier results by HPQCD. We also perform a HQET-based parameterization of the P-wave form factors to shed new light on the 1/2-vs-3/2 puzzle. This work constitutes a step toward a unified lattice treatment of inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays, relevant for the Vcb puzzle. In this study, we use lattice ensembles from the RBC/UKQCD collaboration for numerical investigations. Future developments from our group will focus on the control of other systematic effects for inclusive decays and investigations of other techniques with reduced statistical errors to extract exclusive contributions from lattice four-point correlators."}

So far, all such realizations have been based on interactions among $s$ orbitals, without incorporating inter-orbital couplings. Here, we demonstrate higher-orbital Floquet topological insulators by introducing periodically modulated couplings between the optical $s$ and $p$ orbitals in a square lattice. The staggered phase of the $s$-$p$ couplings gives rise to a synthetic uniform $π$ magnetic flux per plaquette of the lattice, and periodic driving of the couplings opens a topological bandgap, characterized by the Floquet winding number. We image topological edge modes of $s$-$p$ orbitals traveling unidirectionally around a corner. Here, the topological phases are realized by a combined effect of the periodic driving and synthetic magnetic flux. Consequently, when the synthetic flux is turned off, the system becomes trivial over a range of driving parameters. Our results open a promising pathway for exploring topological phenomena by introducing the orbital degree of freedom."}

To exploit the full information content of electromagnetic waves, more advanced elements are required. This has driven the development of multifunctional components, which for example, simultaneously detect and emit intensity or extract intensity and spectral information. However, no pixel exists that both senses and generates optical wavefronts with full control over amplitude, phase, and polarisation, limiting reciprocal control and feedback of sophisticated light fields. Here we present a route to such pixels by demonstrating a versatile platform of miniaturised diffractive elements based on Fourier optics. We exploit plasmonic surface waves, which propagate coherently and efficiently across metallic surfaces. When these plasmons are launched towards wavy microstructures designed with simple Fourier analysis, arbitrary and background-free optical wavefronts are generated. Conversely, incoming light can be sensed and its amplitude, phase, and polarisation fully characterised. By combining or superposing several such components, we create multifunctional 'Fourier pixels' that provide compact and accurate control over the optical field. Our approach, which could also use photonic waveguide modes, establishes a scalable, universal architecture for vectorially programmable pixels with applications in adaptive optics, holographic displays, optical communication, and quantum-information processing."}

However, conventional optical fiber sensors are often limited by strong parameter cross sensitivity, poor discrimination capability, and increased system complexity when multiple sensing units are required. In this work, a compact multi-parameter optical fiber sensing platform is proposed based on a cascaded single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, and long-period fiber grating structure, combined with a wavelength-based spectral demodulation strategy. Within the cascaded configuration, multiple characteristic spectral troughs arising from distinct physical mechanisms coexist in a single transmission spectrum. Interference-induced troughs are generated by the multimode fiber section, while a resonance-induced trough is introduced by the long-period fiber grating. Although none of these troughs responds exclusively to a single parameter, each exhibits simultaneous and linearly independent responses to temperature, axial strain, and refractive index with distinct sensitivity magnitudes and trends. Consequently, each trough can be described by a unique sensitivity vector, enabling robust multi-parameter discrimination through multi-wavelength spectral demodulation."}

Though higher-order topological type-I hyperbolic lattices have been extensively studied, their counterpart, higher-order topological type-II hyperbolic lattices, have never been reported yet. Here, by mapping the celebrated Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model onto a type-II hyperbolic lattice, we present a theoretical exploration of the first-order topological edge states and second-order topological corner states in a type-II hyperbolic lattice. Compared with the higher-order topological type-I hyperbolic lattices, we discover two unique topological phenomena that stem from the nontrivial geometrical topology of the type-II hyperbolic lattice. First, topological edge and corner states exist on both inner and outer boundaries of the type-II hyperbolic lattice and exhibit higher degeneracy than those in the type-I hyperbolic lattice with only an outer boundary. Second, the degeneracy of type-II hyperbolic corner states can be arbitrarily tuned by changing the characteristic (or inner) radius, in contrast to its type-I counterpart, which is determined by the number of sides of the tessellated polygons. Our work explores topological states in more complex hyperbolic lattices, significantly expanding the research scope of hyperbolic topological physics."}

However, prior work has mostly focused on spatial topological states at the single outer edge of type-I hyperbolic lattices. The dynamic transfer of hyperbolic topological states across multiple edges, as well as the emergence of spatiotemporal topological phenomena, remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish both spatial and spatiotemporal topologies in a newly discovered type-II hyperbolic lattice possessing outer and inner edges. Using electric circuits, we experimentally realize a type-II hyperbolic Chern insulator and directly observe degenerate chiral edge states of opposite chirality at its outer and inner edges. Furthermore, by coupling these counter-propagating chiral edge states, we demonstrate an anti-time-parity phase transition, enabling dynamic transfer between them in arbitrary proportions. Finally, we propose a novel paradigm for constructing a (2+1)-dimensional hyperbolic space-time crystal, which hosts an intertwined topology of spatial Chern and temporal winding numbers, resulting in a unique space-time topological string state. Our work expands the frontier of hyperbolic topological physics, paving the way for the spatiotemporal dynamic manipulation of hyperbolic topological states."}

The behavior of finite-size systems is traditionally understood to be governed by fundamental oscillatory modes arising from bulk physics and boundary conditions. A paradigmatic example is the particle-in-a-box model introduced with the advent of quantum mechanics, in which confinement leads to discrete resonances and quantized energy levels. Such quantization underpins phenomena including semiconductor quantum dots, where electronic waves are confined in all three spatial dimensions, producing standing-wave modes analogous to the vibrational states of a guitar string. These modes are characterized by integer quantum numbers corresponding to the number of envelope oscillations fitting within the cavity. Recently, counter-intuitive modes have been observed in finite systems with Dirac dispersion, including states that do not oscillate spatially, yet a general theoretical framework for modes in such cavities has been lacking. Here, we discover the phenomenon of arbitrary fractional quantization in wave physics and show that, in finite-size boxes with linear dispersion, the quantum number need not be an integer but can take any real value, including zero. Using Bloch theory in a Dirac-cone photonic crystal with a controllable fractional number of unit cells at its boundaries, we demonstrate continuous control of the cavity-mode envelope wavenumber. We introduce a unified nomenclature for these unconventional modes and derive their corresponding wavefunctions. These counter-intuitive states in open Dirac potentials challenge conventional notions of quantization and open new avenues across wave physics."}
