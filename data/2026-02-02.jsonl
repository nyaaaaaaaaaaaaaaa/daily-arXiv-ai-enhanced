The spectrum emitted by the SLD exhibits a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of $\\sim$80 nm centred near 2.1 $μ\\mathrm{m}$. For OCT operation, stable amplified spontaneous emission with low spectral ripple ($<20\\%$) is maintained at drive currents below 150 mA. The SLD is fiber coupled and integrated into a fiber-based Michelson interferometer. In the OCT system, the measured coherence envelope yields an axial resolution of approximately 300 $μ$m in air and enables depth-resolved imaging of scattering paint-based coating samples. In contrast to OCT implementations at 2 $μ\\mathrm{m}$ wavelength region that commonly rely on supercontinuum sources, the use of GaSb-based SLDs offers a compact practical alternative, leveraging the maturity and scalability of electrically driven semiconductor light sources packaged in a standard \"butterfly\" module. This report represents the first demonstration of TD-OCT imaging at 2 $μ\\mathrm{m}$ using a GaSb-based SLD source and establishes its suitability for compact and scalable mid-IR OCT instrumentation targeting non-biological, low-water-content materials."}

Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems. Photonic neuromorphic networks (PNNs) are particularly attractive because they leverage the inherent advantages of light, namely high parallelism, low latency, and exceptional energy efficiency. Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. Here, we introduce a purely photonic deep PNN architecture that enables online, unsupervised learning. We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing. This work unlocks the potential of photonic computing for complex artificial intelligence applications by enabling direct, high-throughput processing of optical information without intermediate OEO signal conversions."}

Our experiments confirm the Janus coherent emission, and they are validated by the results of the coupled-mode theory. The flatband resonant metasurfaces enabling a control of chiral thermal emission provide an efficient platform for spin-controlled light-matter interaction."}

Recently, there has been growing interest in plasmons for applications in quantum information processing. Electrons floating on liquid helium provide an exceptionally clean, disorder-free system and have emerged as a promising platform for this purpose. In this work, we establish this system as a tunable plasmon-photon hybrid platform. We demonstrate strong coupling between floating-electron plasmons and radio-frequency (RF) photons confined in an LC resonator. Time-resolved measurements reveal coherent oscillatory energy exchange between the plasmonic and photonic modes, providing direct evidence of their coherent coupling. These results represent a step towards cavity quantum electrodynamics with a floating-electron plasmon coupled to a resonator. Furthermore, the LC resonator serves as a sensitive probe of electron-on-helium physics, enabling the observation of the Wigner crystal transition and a quantitative study of the temperature-dependent plasmon decay arising from ripplon-induced scattering."}

Lanczos residual bounds address this by providing two-sided constraints on energies that do not require assumptions beyond Hermiticity, but often give very conservative systematic uncertainty estimates. Here, a more-constraining set of gap bounds is introduced for hadron spectroscopy. These bounds provide tighter constraints whose validity requires an explicit assumption about an energy gap. Exactly solvable lattice field theory correlators are used to test the utility of residual and gap bounds at finite and infinite statistics. Two-sided bounds and other analysis methods are then applied to a high-statistics LQCD calculation of nucleon-nucleon scattering at $m_π\\sim 800$ MeV. Generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) and Lanczos energy estimators are compatible when applied to the same correlator data, but analyses including different interpolating operators show statistically significant inconsistencies. However, two-sided bounds from all operators are consistent. Under the assumption that the number of energy levels below $NΔ$ and $ΔΔ$ thresholds is the same as for non-interacting nucleons, gap bounds are sufficient to constrain nucleon-nucleon scattering amplitudes at phenomenologically relevant precision. Lanczos methods further reveal that energy-eigenstate estimates from previously studied asymmetric correlators have not converged over accessible imaginary times. Nevertheless, data-driven examples demonstrate why assumptions are required to draw conclusions about the natures of two-nucleon ground states at these masses."}

The method is derived from a second-order asymptotic expansion in the propagation distance $L$ and complemented by the leading Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB)\n  wave-optics correction, yielding an efficient iterative correction scheme preconditioned by FFT-diagonal, energy-dependent inverse operators (Paganin-type filters). To ensure robustness across practical experimental regimes, we combine two complementary solvers: (i) a local $O(L^2)$ closure that is accurate when eikonal shifts remain sub-pixel, and (ii) a non-local formulation for multi-pixel shifts, in which intensity is propagated through an explicit eikonal ray mapping using a mass-conserving bilinear redisribution on the detector grid, and detector residuals are transferred back to the object grid by the corresponding adjoint (transpose), implemented as bilinear interpolation, before applying an approximate FFT-diagonal preconditioner to accelerate convergence. The same framework supports polychromatic data through a compact spectral discretisation, allowing energy-dependent transport and inversion while keeping the iteration GPU/FFT efficient. Overall, this unified approach enables accurate and computationally efficient phase retrieval across propagation conditions relevant to high-throughput PPC-$μ$CT experiments."}

Valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer an attractive path: by opening a gap at the Dirac points of a hexagonal lattice, one can engineer guided modes confined to domain walls that thread around corners with reduced backreflection. We develop a design framework that co-optimizes the photonic bulk band gap and valley Chern number using a modified particle-swarm optimization (PSO), while evaluating the photonic band structure via plane-wave expansion and the topological characteristics using a gauge-invariant lattice discretization to compute the Berry-curvature. The optimized structures exhibit a clean valley-Hall gap with edge bands traversing the gap and high interface transmission in full-wave simulations. These results consolidate topology-aware geometry optimization for robust on-chip guiding."}

Within this framework, we derive explicit expressions for the scattering matrix of the dynamic system in a first-order Born approximation, relating it directly to the corresponding static problem. We show that inelastic scattering amplitudes are governed by overlap integrals between static modes at the input and output frequencies. Using this insight, we analyze scattering from a time-modulated, isotropic, dielectric sphere and a high-permittivity dielectric cylinder, and demonstrate how modal orthogonality can suppress inelastic channels, while appropriate tuning of geometric parameters can significantly enhance them. In particular, we show that cylindrical resonators support strong inelastic scattering when resonance-to-resonance optical transitions, induced by the temporal variation, involve a high-Q supercavity mode. Comparison with full time-Floquet calculations confirms that the first-order Born approximation remains quantitatively accurate for modest modulation amplitudes and provides clear physical intuition for frequency conversion and resonance-mediated scattering processes in time-modulated photonic resonators."}

By uncovering the precise relationship between the winding number of structured light and the topological charge of magnetic textures, we establish a fundamental topological connection between light and magnetism. This framework enables ultrafast, all-optical encoding of diverse topological spin textures in magnetic media, including skyrmions, antiskyrmions and skyrmion bags.

The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. With the success in demonstrating spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, an alternative process to generate photon pairs, spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), also starts to attract interest. In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear susceptibility $χ^{(2)}$, SFWM can generate photon pairs both directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility $χ^{(3)}$, and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cascaded process is more efficient. Here, we show that in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN). The existence of both second- and third-order nonlinear processes offers broader opportunities for quantum state engineering."}

The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance. To further intensify photon confinement, a dielectric SiO2 sphere is partially embedded in the ITO layer, improving long-wavelength absorbance and increasing electron-hole pair generation near the active region. We analyzed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to examine the optical properties of our proposed structure. This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport.

This phenomenon is typically hidden in the total scattered field, as the field is scattered much less toward the backward hemisphere than toward the forward one.

It was theoretically predicted that, for microspheres, electric and magnetic dipolar coefficients can simultaneously vanish by engineering the incident light, leading to the excitation of nonradiating hybrid optical anapoles. In this work, the experimental detection of hybrid optical anapoles in dielectric microspheres (TiO2) is reported using dual detection optical spectroscopy, developed to enable sequential measurement of forward and backward scattering under tightly_focused Gaussian beam (TFGB) illumination. The results show that the excitation of TiO2 microspheres (diameter, d approx. 1 um) under TFGB illumination leads to the appearance of scattering minima in both the forward and backward directions within specific wavelength ranges. These scattering minima are found to be due to vanishing electric and magnetic dipolar coefficients associated with hybrid optical anapoles. The ability to confine electromagnetic fields associated with hybrid optical anapoles can give rise to several novel optical phenomena and applications."}
