The SHG efficiency is measured to be (3.52 +/- 0.04) x 10^-3 %/W.

However, existing conversion\ntechniques rely on cavity-enhanced interactions, which limit the bandwidth and\ncalability. Here, we demonstrate the first multi-channel microwave-to-optics\nconversion by introducing a traveling-wave architecture that leverages a hybrid\nphotonic-phononic waveguide on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our approach\nexploits continuous phase-matching rather than discrete resonances, enabling\nunprecedented operational bandwidths exceeding 40 nm in the optical domain and\n250 MHz in the microwave domain. By harnessing the strong piezoelectric and\nphotoelastic effects of TFLN, we achieve coherent conversion between 9 GHz\nmicrowave photons and 1550 nm telecom photons via traveling phonons, with an\ninternal efficiency of 2.2% (system efficiency 2.4 *10^-4 ) at room\ntemperature. Remarkably, we demonstrate simultaneous operation of nine\nconversion channels in a single device. Our converter opens up new\nopportunities for seamless integration of microwave and photonic technologies,\nenabling the quantum interface for distributed quantum computing with\nsuperconducting quantum processors, high efficient microwave signal processing,\nand advanced radar applications."}

Optical tweezers serve as a tool for the parking of dye\ndoped nematic microdroplets on gold nanoparticle clusters, enabling the dynamic\ncoupling and excitation of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs).

The magnitude of tunability depends on the size of\nthe gold nanoparticle cluster.

This\nis a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer\nmatrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a\ndynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency\nscattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the\nscattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the\nconstruction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose\ntime-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct\nthe low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and\ntransmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of\nBrewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive\nanalytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and\nnon-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of\nthis method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when\nthe carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary\nconditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space.

Solving the Hermitian positive definite\nsystems, which are sparse but ill-conditioned, involves using iterative\nmethods, such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), which are time-consuming and\ncomputationally expensive. Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this\nprocess, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners. However,\nconstructing useful preconditioners can be challenging, adding additional\ncomputational overhead, especially in large linear systems. We propose a\nframework, leveraging operator learning techniques, to construct linear maps as\neffective preconditioners. The method in this work does not rely on explicit\nmatrices from either the original linear systems or the produced\npreconditioners, allowing efficient model training and application in the CG\nsolver. In the context of the Schwinger model U(1) gauge theory in 1+1\nspacetime dimensions with two degenerate-mass fermions), this preconditioning\nscheme effectively decreases the condition number of the linear systems and\napproximately halves the number of iterations required for convergence in\nrelevant parameter ranges. We further demonstrate the framework learns a\ngeneral mapping dependent on the lattice structure which leads to zero-shot\nlearning ability for the Dirac operators constructed from gauge field\nconfigurations of different sizes."}

This article introduces a He-Ne laser\nimaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The\nsystem enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its\nsurroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby\npreserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied\nto both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is\nobservable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample\ntypes were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation)\nand a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne\nradiation).

We show that, while resonance peaks in the\nspectral functions can be reconstructed using this method, it is difficult to\nreconstruct transport peaks without further assumptions beyond SpM. Then we\nextract charmonium spectral functions from correlation functions obtained from\nlattice QCD at temperatures below and above the critical temperature.

Such measurements\nare nonetheless challenging due to helium's low refractive index contrast,\nrestricted optical access to the cryogenic setups required to maintain helium\nin its superfluid phase, and mechanical vibrations from the various cooling\nstages. Overcoming these limitations will enable quantitative studies of\nsurface-wave dynamics with applications in fluid mechanics, quantum simulation,\nand quantum optomechanics. Here we report the first implementation of off-axis\ndigital holography for full-field imaging of the free surface of superfluid\n$^{\\text{4}}$He. We perform non-contact measurements of nanometre- to\nmicrometre-scale interface fluctuations in two cryogenic systems: a traditional\nhelium bath cryostat and a cryogen-free refrigerator. We employ\nmachine-learning-based analysis to isolate noise-driven normal modes and their\nspatial structure in both systems. This enables reconstruction of the\ndispersion relation for gravity-capillary waves in macroscopic samples and, for\nthick films, determination of the film thickness from the measured dispersion,\nproviding a quantitative benchmark for our approach.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the\nself-focusing effect in optical media can accelerate the appearance of the\nfirst branching points and sharpen the filaments of branched flow. In this\nstudy, we investigate the influence of the nonlocality of the nonlinear\nresponse on branched flow. We find that, due to its averaging effect, as the\nrange of nonlocality increases, the first branching point shifts to a greater\ndistance, and the flow structures broaden, thus nonlocality ultimately restores\nthe branched flow to its linear condition.
