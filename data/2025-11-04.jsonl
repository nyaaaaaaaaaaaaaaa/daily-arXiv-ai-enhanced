These modes exhibit substantially higher quality (Q) and Purcell\nfactors than either the standalone nanoparticle array or the bare cavity. This\nmechanism enables the formation of highly isolated, spectrally pure electric\nand magnetic modes with dipolar or multipolar character. In representative\nphotonically doped Bragg cavities, we predict Q factors on the order of 10000\nand magnetic-dipole Purcell factors exceeding 4000 in the near-infrared region,\nassociated with strong and high-Q magnetic hot spots localized within the\nnanoparticles. These results establish photonic doping of ENZ Bragg cavities as\na powerful paradigm for achieving ultra-narrow-bandwidth, pure electric or\nmagnetic Mie resonances, with exceptional potential for low-threshold nonlinear\noptics, magnetic dipole spectroscopy in atomic systems, and strong quantum\noptical light-matter interactions."}

Temple", "Benjamin Thompson", "Dusan Sarenac"], "title": "Topological Expansion of Boehm's Brushes via Structured Light", "comment": null, "summary": "We report a novel entoptic phenomenon in which the classical two-lobed\nBoehm's brushes are transformed into a multi-lobed structure by projecting\nspin-orbit coupled light onto the human retina. These structured beams,\ncomposed of non-separable superpositions of circular polarization and orbital\nangular momentum (OAM), produce azimuthally modulated entoptic patterns through\npolarization-dependent scattering in the retina. Unlike Haidinger's brushes,\nwhich arise from dichroic absorption in the macula, the observed effect is\ndriven by angular variations in scattering strength relative to the local\npolarization direction. In regions where scattering centers exhibit\npolarization orientations that converge toward a common point, their combined\ncontributions reinforce one another, producing brighter and more sharply\ndefined entoptic lobes whose number and orientation vary systematically with\nthe topology of the spin-orbit stimulus. Psychophysical measurements across\nretinal eccentricities from 0.5$^\\circ$ to 4$^\\circ$ in eleven participants\nrevealed that contrast detection thresholds decreased exponentially with\neccentricity, consistent with polarization-sensitive scattering by isotropic\nstructures in the non-foveal retinal regions. From the psychophysical fits, the\nmean eccentricity at which the entoptic pattern reached a 50 % threshold was\n$r_{50} = 1.03^\\circ$ with a 95 % confidence interval of [0.72, 1.34]$^\\circ$,\nindicating that the spin-orbit-induced entoptic structure becomes perceptually\nrobust at approximately 1$^\\circ$ retinal eccentricity. Together, these\nfindings demonstrate that spin-orbit light modulates scattering-based visual\nphenomena in previously unrecognized ways, enabling new approaches for probing\nretinal structure and visual processing using topological features of light."}

The on-chip comb sources are currently based on electro-optic\nmodulation, mode-locked lasers, quantum cascade lasers, or soliton formation\nvia Kerr nonlinearity. However, the widespread deployment of on-chip comb\nsources has remained elusive as they still require RF sources, high-Q\nresonators, or complex stabilization schemes while facing efficiency\nchallenges. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip source of frequency comb based on\nthe integration of a lithium niobate nanophotonic circuit with a semiconductor\nlaser that can alleviate these challenges. For the first time, we show the\nformation of temporal topological solitons in a on-chip nanophotonic parametric\noscillator with quadratic nonlinearity and low finesse. These solitons,\nindependent of the dispersion regime, consist of phase defects separating two\n$\\pi$-out-of-phase continuous wave solutions at the signal frequency, which is\nat half the input pump frequency. We use on-chip cross-correlation for temporal\nmeasurements and confirm formation of topological solitons as short as 60 fs\naround 2 $\\mu$m, in agreement with a generalized parametrically forced\nGinzburg-Landau theory. Moreover, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept turn-key\noperation of a hybrid-integrated source of topological frequency comb.\nTopological solitons offer a new paradigm for integrated comb sources, which\nare dispersion-sign agnostic and do not require high-Q resonators or high-speed\nmodulators and can provide access to hard-to-access spectral regions, including\nmid-infrared."}
