The\nmethods explored include Tikhonov regularization, the Backus-Gilbert method,\nthe Bayesian approach with Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) prior, and the\nfeedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs). We evaluate the performance of\nthese methods using both mock data generated from toy models and real lattice\ndata from quasi distribution, and further compare them with the physics-driven\n$\\lambda$-extrapolation approach. Our results demonstrate that the L-IDFT\nconstitutes a moderately tractable inverse problem Except for the\nBackus-Gilbert method, all the other approaches are capable of correctly\nreconstructing the quasi-distributions in momentum space. In particular, the\nBayesian approach with GRW and the feedforward ANNs yield more stable and\naccurate reconstructions. Based on these investigations, we conclude that, for\na given L-IDFT problem, selecting an appropriate reconstruction method\naccording to the input data and carefully assessing the potential systematic\nuncertainties are essential for obtaining reliable results."}

Piston-motion micromirror-based\nSLMs support high-speed ($\\geq$ 10 kHz) phase modulation; however, fabricating\nmicromirror arrays with sufficient fill factor necessary for high diffraction\nefficiency is challenging. In particular, the larger mirrors of high fill\nfactor designs are susceptible to stress-induced curvature that significantly\ndegrades optical performance. In this work, we introduce an optical\ncompensation method using a pitch-matched microlens array (MLA) to focus light\nonto just the center of each mirror. Our approach thus avoids curvature-induced\nartifacts and improves optical fill factor to nearly 100$\\%$, independent of\nthe original mechanical fill factor. Through simulations and experiments on a\nfabricated micromirror array with bowed mirrors, we show that the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient of the imparted phase profile is improved from 0.11 to\n0.85 and the brightness of a holographically-generated single spot is enhanced\nby 8$\\times$ with our microlens array in place.

An outstanding question is\nwhether sparsely coupled network structures exist that lead to strong\nsynchronization. This paper gives an affirmative answer: optimal sparse\ncoupling configurations can be found which enables near-complete\nsynchronization. Quite surprisingly, with respect to synchronization, certain\nsparse networks can outperform fully coupled networks, when the weights of\ncoupling are placed dominantly on the laser pairs with large frequency\ndifferences.

Harnessing the coupled piezoelectric and strain fields of\nSAWs, this integrated approach allows for dynamic, precise, and fully\ncontactless control of excitonic properties, a capability essential for the\nrealization of next generation optoelectronic, quantum photonic, and excitonic\ndevices. We identify two distinct modulable interlayer excitons in optical\ncommunication bands: IX$_{K\\Gamma}$ in the O band (around 1300 nm) and\nIX$_{K\\!-\\!K}$ in the S band (around 1500 nm); these two excitons display a\nrobust twist-angle-independent energy splitting of 120 meV, in agreement with\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. The type-II band alignment\ninduced by the SAW not only promotes efficient exciton dissociation but also\nenables direct and tunable modulation of photoluminescence via the formation of\nconfined piezoelectric potential wells. Furthermore, by simultaneously\ngenerating in-plane and out-of-plane SAW fields, the platform achieves\nselective manipulation of intralayer and interlayer excitons, inducing\nquadratic Stark effects for intralayer excitons and linear Stark effects for\ninterlayer excitons.
