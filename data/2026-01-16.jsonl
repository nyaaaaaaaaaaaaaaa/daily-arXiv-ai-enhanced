By interpreting intensity as a probability density, we show that a) free-space diffraction will always act to flatten the intensity distribution as the beam propagates, and consequently b) diffraction will monotonically minimize the Fisher Information with respect to any parameterization of the intensity distribution model that depends on propagation distance."}

Recent developments have indicated the existence of a `coherence advantage' in multimode optical communications, where partially coherent light outperforms coherent light. However, exploiting partial coherence in such applications requires manipulating multimode field coherence in programmable on-chip platforms. We present here the first example of on-chip synthesis and characterization of two-mode optical fields in an integrated on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Starting with incoherent two-mode light, we adjust the degree of coherence on the chip with non-unitary transformations, construct $2\\times2$ unitary transformations to synthesize prescribed coherence matrices, and reconstruct the coherence matrices via measurements of the spatial Stokes parameters. These results indicate the possibility of deploying programmable photonics for producing large-dimensional structured partially coherent light for applications in communications, cryptography, sensing, and spectroscopy."}

In parallel, advances in nanophotonics have enabled wavefront control through metasurfaces, a capability that has transformed fields such as microscopy by allowing tailored control of optical propagation. This naturally raises the following question, which we address in this perspective: can wavefront-control strategies be leveraged to improve scintillation-based imaging? To answer this question, we explore nanophotonic- and metasurface-enabled wavefront control in scintillators to mitigate image blurring arising from their intrinsically diffuse light emission. While depth-of-field extension in scintillation faces fundamental limitations absent in microscopy, this approach reveals promising avenues, including stacked scintillators, selective spatial-frequency enhancement, and X-ray energy-dependent imaging. These results clarify the key distinctions in adapting wavefront engineering to scintillation and its potential to enable tailored detection strategies."}

Building on the established partial coherence model of [T. Pfeifer et. al, Opt. Lett. 35, 3441 (2010)], we demonstrate that the implementation of a variable coherence width allows for continuous control over the pulses' characteristic noise, while keeping the average pulse parameters such as the bandwidth fixed. We demonstrate this through systematic statistical analyses of the intensity and number of sub-pulses in VCM pulses, in both time and frequency. In particular, we analyze how the sub-pulse statistics are affected by the coherence width parameter. We perform our analyses across three distinct regimes of FEL parameters and demonstrate how the VCM can generate pulses that range from maximally random to fully coherent. Finally, we illustrate the effect of the VCM variable coherence width on an absorption simulation."}

These transient optics are immune to target debris and shrapnel and feature orders-of-magnitude higher damage thresholds than conventional solid optics, providing a promising method for efficiently manipulating high-energy lasers. In this work, we describe gas gratings that can efficiently diffract probe beams across a variety of wavelengths and pulse durations, ranging from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared and from nanosecond to femtosecond, achieving a full beam diffraction efficiency up to 99% while preserving the focusability and wavefront quality. In addition, we present a comprehensive characterization of the performance of the gas gratings under various experimental conditions, including imprint fluence, gas composition, and grating geometries, showing significant enhancement of this process with the addition of carbon dioxide. We also demonstrate stable performance over hours of operation. Our results validate a previously developed theoretical model and suggest optimal parameters to efficiently scale gas gratings to high-energy applications."}

We apply an extended HAL QCD potential method to a baryonic system made up from a static quark and a diquark. Numerical calculations are performed by employing 2+1 flavor QCD gaugeconfigurations generated by CP-PACS and JLQCD Collaborations on a $16^{3} \\times 32$ lattice with $a^{-1} \\approx 1.6$ GeV. To improve the statistical noise in the propagators of the static quark, the HYP smearing is employed on the gauge links. Two-point correlators of quark-diquark baryonic system are then computed to obtain their ground-state energies where various types of diquarks are considered (eg: scalar diquark, axial-vector diquark etc). We apply an extended HAL QCD method on a baryonic system made up from a scalar diquark and a static quark to study the scalar diquark mass and the quark-diquark potential. In order to determine the diquark mass self-consistently in this HALQCD method, we demand that the baryonic spectrum in the p-wave sector obtained from the two-point correlators should be reproduced by the potential obtained from the baryonic system in the s-wave sector. We obtain the scalar diquark mass of roughly $(2/3) m_{N}$ , i.e., twice the naïve estimates of a constituent quark mass together with the quark-diquark potential of Cornell type (Coulomb + linear)."}

In this study, the prestigious FUHAO bronze artifact (late Shang period, 13th-11th century BCE) was non-destructively examined using pulsed thermal imaging (PT). By combining single- and double-layer heat conduction models with Thermal Tomography (TT), this approach allowed for precise spatial localization of repair crevices, patches, and filler materials, while also distinguishing restorative interventions from the original bronze substrate. The artifact was revealed to have been assembled from multiple fragments, exhibiting uneven surface corrosion and clear evidence of prior conservation. The results not only provide direct insights for conservation strategy and historical interpretation but also demonstrate the capability of pulsed thermal imaging as an effective diagnostic tool for the integrated surface and subsurface assessment of cultural heritage objects."}

In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators."}

FF-SS-OCM provides high-definition OCT images, but, particularly in DOCT imaging, it results in a significant enlargement of the data size and subsequently long data streaming and processing time, which prevents high-throughput imaging. We address this issue by introducing an NN-based DOCT method that generates high-definition logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) -based DOCT images from only four OCT volumes, whereas the conventional method required 32 volumes. The NN model successfully generates an LIV image that is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the LIV image computed from 32 volumes. This approach significantly reduces data size, transfer time, and processing time for DOCT imaging by a factor of eight. Specifically, these were reduced from 42 GB to 5.3 GB, 7 min to 55 s, and 4 hours to 30 min, respectively."}

Here we experimentally investigate light-induced forces on dielectric particles near epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial surfaces using photonic force microscopy. By illuminating trapped particles with tunable visible light, we observe a wavelength-dependent repulsive force unique to ENZ surfaces, contrasting with the attractive forces near dielectric or metallic substrates. This repulsion peaks near the ENZ frequency and may be attributed to combined optical ENZ effects and thermophoretic forces. Our findings demonstrate that ENZ metamaterials can induce stable levitation of particles via light-driven forces, offering a novel mechanism for contactless manipulation in microfluidic environments. This work advances understanding of light-matter interactions at ENZ interfaces and suggests potential for ENZ-based optical control of micro- and nanoscale objects, with potential applications in micro- and nanofluidic environments."}

By co-engineering guided-mode resonances, surface lattice resonances near Rayleigh anomalies, and quasi-bound states in the continuum, we realize complementary high-Q feedback pathways that overlap with the gain spectrum. The direction of the lasing emission is tailored through outcoupling via second-order Bragg diffraction and Rayleigh anomaly conditions, supporting both normal and oblique emission. Experiments reveal discrete lasing outputs across ~100 nm bandwidth (548-648 nm), spanning nearly the full Rhodamine 6G emission band, with thresholds as low as ~7 nJ per pulse (35.7 uJ/cm^2) and up to four concurrent lasing peaks from a single device. These results establish a metasurface-dye platform for multifrequency and angle-selective lasing, opening new opportunities for compact, multifunctional nanophotonic sources."}
