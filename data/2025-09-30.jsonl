Such\nfs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light\nthat are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while\nsimultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high\npeak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique\ntools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time\nrequired to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling,\nfrom the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse\nenergy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via\ndiffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence,\nthe fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or\nablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred\nnanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable\nnonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation\nand relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the\nreasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials\nprocessing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids.\nWe identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision\nor the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or\nprocessing rates.

The theory is\nbased on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger perturbation\ntheory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling\nis derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the\nWannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states\nat the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that\nin the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a\ntwisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb\nlattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a\nfour-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer\ncase, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals\nthat for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\\Gamma} point\nvia the moir\\'e potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a\nwide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large\ntwist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The\ncavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a\ndivergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics,\nlasing and quantum optics."}

In this context, orbital angular momentum\n(OAM) stands out as a powerful resource for optical multiplexing, offering\naccess to an unbounded set of orthogonal modes. To harness this potential,\nmetasurfaces, with their considerable ability to control light, have emerged as\nkey platforms for OAM-multiplexed holography. Nevertheless, conventional OAM\nholography suffers from limited polarization engineering capabilities due to\nthe lack of chirality control in single-layer metasurfaces. Here, we introduce\na bi-layer metasurface architecture that realizes total angular momentum (TAM)\nvectorial holography, where TAM represents the combination of spin angular\nmomentum (SAM, equivalent to polarization) and OAM of light. In contrast to\nprevious approaches, this scheme enables true polarization-OAM multiplexing,\nfacilitating the independent generation of vectorial holographic images for\neach orthogonal TAM input state. This concept is validated numerically and\nexperimentally, confirming the feasibility of TAM vectorial holography. The\nproposed scheme can be easily integrated with other recent holography\ngeneration approaches, such as vector beam multiplexing and bidirectional\nholography, thereby further expanding its multiplexing capability.

To address this, we propose and\nexperimentally demonstrate, using the thin film lithium niobate (TFLN)\nphotonics, a modular, recursive optical signal processing framework. In our\napproach, fast electro-optic (EO) switch is used to either keep an optical\npacket inside the loop, with the processing element embedded within, or to\nrelease it from the loop and direct it towards the output waveguide. By\nconfiguring the switch on a timescale shorter than a time the photon spends\ntraversing the loop, this architecture can achieve different optical\npathlengths in a compact footprint without sacrificing optical bandwidth. As an\nexample, we embed a phase-modulator (PM) inside the loop and demonstrate a\nfrequency shift of optical packets up to 420 GHz, using only a 3 GHz sinusoidal\nmicrowave signal.
