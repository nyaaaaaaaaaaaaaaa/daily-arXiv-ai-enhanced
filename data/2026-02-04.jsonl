Here, we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of 2D stealthy hyperuniform metasurfaces operating at optical frequencies. In agreement with theoretical expectations, we observe a pronounced reduction of elastic scattering around the specular direction in metasurfaces fabricated by electron-beam lithography. However, the measured suppression is substantially weaker than that predicted by structure-factor calculations based on ideal stealthy hyperuniform point-pattern generators. We identify and quantitatively analyze the physical origins of this discrepancy, and establish realistic performance bounds. By isolating the dominant limiting mechanisms, our results provide practical design guidelines for the implementation of stealthy hyperuniform metasurfaces in functional photonic devices."}

However, the downscaling actuation of conventional gears and micromotors has remained limited by the inherent challenges of implementing mechanical/electrical powering. Here, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of an optomechanical, gear-driven micromachine realized through two-photon polymerization 3D printing. The actuation is achieved using optical tweezers. The device integrates a microgear transmission system with an optically actuated part, enabling light-controlled micromachines. When illuminated by a highly focused laser source, the first gear generates rotational torque within the gear assembly, converting optical energy into directional mechanical work that can be transmitted to the coupled gear. We demonstrate the fabrication of micromachines using two-photon polymerization (2PP) laser writing, enabling the fabrication of spur gear trains and bevel gears that can produce out-of-plane rotations, which is not achievable with traditional micromachining fabrication techniques. The micromachines are composed of a single gear or a train of two or three gears without any unwanted adhesion between the components, leading to functioning systems. Experimentally, the fabricated micromachines were actuated using optical tweezers, demonstrating continuous gear rotation, effective motion transmission in gear trains, out-of-plane rotations, and the ability to amplify velocity or torque. Optical-tweezer actuation broadens the potential applications of these micromachines, particularly in biomedical and lab-on-a-chip systems, where precise, minimally invasive control at the microscale is essential."}

This approach enables the temporal characterization of the ultrafast emission dynamics under short-pulse excitation with picosecond time resolution. When a weak continuous-wave component is added to the pulsed pump, the emission becomes deterministic and the build-up time is considerably reduced. The difference between purely pulsed and hybrid excitation regimes points to the influence of pulse-to-pulse timing fluctuations. To elucidate this effect, we perform Langevin-based simulations that reproduce the experimentally observed broadening and confirm that time jitter, originating from spontaneous-emission noise near threshold, dominates the temporal dispersion. These results establish four-wave-mixing gating as a powerful method to probe nanolaser dynamics with picosecond precision."}

While optical systems provide a controlled setting for studying these phenomena, achieving deterministic control over their generation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to induce and precisely modulate extreme events in a semiconductor VCSEL using polarization-controlled optical feedback. By integrating a $λ$/2-waveplate into a polarization-selective external cavity, we regulate the nonlinear interaction between TE and TM modes. This setup triggers high-intensity, heavy-tailed fluctuations in the TM mode, exhibiting clear signatures of extreme events. We show that these events arise from deterministic energy exchange between modes, as evidenced by strong bipolar correlations and long-range temporal memory. The waveplate angle serves as an effective external parameter, enabling non-monotonic tuning of the event rate, intensity, and temporal clustering. Our study establish a platform for exploring extreme events in dissipative systems, with implications for nonlinear photonics and optical technologies."}

We find that the assemblies can be effectively rotated in a two-dimensional optical trap with orbital frequencies of up to 5 Hz. We use video tracking to explore the Brownian dynamics of such a trapping arrangement and look at the impact of orientation stability on measurements of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with an applied weak external magnetic field. By collecting ODMR spectra at multiple points along the orbit, we show that the constrained two-dimensional motion can provide additional insights for vector magnetic field reconstruction."}

Here, we demonstrate a three-order-of-magnitude suppression of radiative heat transfer, resulting in ultralow radiative heat transfer, in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic chain of plasmonic nanoparticles. This suppression in radiative heat transfer is directly correlated with mode localization, as revealed by the mode decomposition of the transmission coefficient, which serves as evidence of Anderson localization. Furthermore, we elucidate the dependence of radiative thermal conductance reduction on interparticle spacing and material damping rates, uncovering the interplay between intrinsic Ohmic losses, mode localization, and long-range many-body interactions. Our findings advance the understanding of wave-mediated thermal transport in disordered photonic structures and suggest strategies for tailoring nanoscale heat management via engineered disorder."}

Near the interface, an evanescent surface plasmon polariton (SPP) channel yields a Néel-type meron lattice with $\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$ like effective site charges. At larger heights, diffracted fields from the square edges dominate and convert the lattice into a Bloch-type configuration. Over a range of intermediate heights, crossover between the evanescent SPP and edge diffraction gives rise to rich rapid topology evolutions. The switching is accompanied by nucleation of off-boundary vortex-anti vortex pairs in the in-plane spin phase, producing height-dependent fractional site charges.

However, their design remains constrained by intuitive, iterative methods that lack flexibility, while also facing challenges in multi-objective optimization. Here, we introduce a deep learning-enabled inverse-design framework that overcomes these limitations through a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The main contribution of this work is a dual-channel image encoding scheme that jointly represents the geometry and thickness of a Si$_3$N$_4$ meta-layer, facilitating the network to learn the distribution of viable structures for a target optical response. This approach naturally solves the inherent ``one-to-many'' design issue, giving a diverse portfolio of functional candidates from a single input spectrum. The designed absorbers achieve exceptional spectral fidelity, with resonance peak errors below 5 nm, a mean squared error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, and the capacity to produce over 10 distinct, high-performance designs per target. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's robustness under oblique illumination, showing that it can be efficiently fine-tuned to maintain spectral accuracy across incidence angles from $10^\\circ$ to $40^\\circ$ by transfer learning, thus extending its practical utility to non-normal operating conditions. Full-wave simulations confirm that the generated geometries support a hybrid plasmonic-dielectric resonance, leading to near-perfect absorption and strong near-field enhancement. Our study provides a robust, physics-aware design paradigm that moves beyond conventional parametric optimization. The introduced framework establishes a versatile platform for the on-demand inverse design of advanced photonic devices for sensing, spectroscopy, and optical signal processing."}

For an open elliptical microcavity in the strong-interaction A.C. regime, we find a distinctive sector-resolved response: amplitude statistics tighten while phase statistics broaden maximally at the mixing point, and conditioning reveals strong amplitude-phase dependence. By introducing a coarse position label and the associated co-information, we further show that the enhancement of global amplitude-phase coupling is strongly shaped by spatial heterogeneity across the cavity."}

Yet enforcing foundry design rules during inverse design remains a major challenge, as optimized devices frequently violate constraints on minimum feature size and spacing. Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics."}

Here, we address these issues experimentally by resolving the trajectory-dependent temporal structure of liquid HHG. By optimizing the laser focusing geometry, we achieve clear spatial discrimination of short- and long-trajectory contributions, providing direct evidence for the existence of multiple quantum trajectories in liquids. Using a phase-controlled two-color driving field, we independently retrieve the attochirp associated with each trajectory and demonstrate opposite energy-time correlations for short and long trajectories, establishing a trajectory-resolved energy-time mapping in liquid HHG. All observations are well reproduced by semiclassical recollision simulations. These results place liquid HHG on the same conceptual footing as gas- and solid-phase HHG and establish a robust foundation for attosecond-resolved spectroscopy of ultrafast electronic and chemical dynamics in liquid environments."}

Depending on the characteristics of the wave packet, particles may be pushed away from the wave source or pulled toward it. We also examine particle dynamics in the field of a beat wave generated by two forward-propagating waves with slightly different frequencies. Such a beat wave can emulate a periodic sequence of either forward- or backward-propagating pulses.

Although topological phononic metamaterials have recently been demonstrated as a promising paradigm for confining and guiding elastic waves through robust bound states, achieving ultrahigh-Q topological resonance with enhanced energy conversion efficiency remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a synthetic-dimensional higher-order topological insulator by engineering the flexural bands of elastic metamaterials, featuring highly localized topological hinge states in the bulk bands. This topological hinge mode stems from the nonzero combination of the bulk polarization and the Chern number in the synthetic-dimensional band structure, thus giving rise to a strong elastic-to-electric energy conversion at the corner of the phononic plate. Through numerical simulations and experimental validations, straightforward evidence of the localized modes with robust protection and consequent abilities in activating the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) array have been demonstrated.
