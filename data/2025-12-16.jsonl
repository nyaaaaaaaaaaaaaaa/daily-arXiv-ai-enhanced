Despite ultra-high precision, security, particularly the unresolved vulnerabilities on physical links beyond traditional cryptography, remains the bottleneck. Here, we develop an analysis framework, the Benchmark Attack Noise Detection (BAND) model, to quantify the security of the high-precision time synchronization when its core assumption, reciprocity, is broken. The model characterizes non-reciprocal attacks through a unified metric, termed attack intensity. Based on the analysis of attack intensity, we accurately predict both instantaneous and accumulating attacks in a 100-km dual-comb two-way time-transfer system. Beyond security considerations, we find that the BAND model can explain intrinsic fiber noise and delay-unsuppressed noise naturally, offering an effective tool to establish an environment-sensitive link model. This work paves the way for a secure large-scale integrated time, sensing and communication networks."}

However, so far on-chip gas sensing based on traditional laser absorption spectroscopy has demonstrated low detection sensitivity, due to weak light-gas interaction over a limited interaction distance. On-chip photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) appears to be a powerful technique to achieve higher sensitivity, its performance is yet constrained to parts-per-million (ppm)-level due to small fraction of evanescent field in the light-gas interaction zone and fast thermal dissipation through the solid substrate. Herein, we demonstrated suspended chalcogenide glass waveguide (ChGW)-enhanced PTS that overcomes these limitations, enabling highly sensitive parts-per-billion (ppb)-level molecular gas sensing. We fabricated a nanoscale suspended ChGW with low loss of 2.6 dB/cm using CMOS-compatible two-step patterning process. By establishing an equivalent PTS model to guide the optimization of the ChGW geometry, we achieved a 4-fold increase in the absorption-induced heat source power and a 10.6-fold decrease in the equivalent heat conductivity, resulting in a 45-fold enhancement in photothermal phase modulation efficiency over the non-suspended waveguides. Combining with a high-contrast waveguide facet-formed Fabry-Perot interferometer, we achieved an unprecedented acetylene detection limit of 330 ppb, a large dynamic range close to 6 orders of magnitude, and a fast response of less than 1 s. The overall system exhibits a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient of 3.8x10-7 cm-1, setting a new benchmark for photonic waveguide gas sensors to the best of our knowledge. This work provides a key advancement towards prototyping an integrated sensor-on-a-chip for highly sensitive and background-free photonic sensing applications."}

Two of the limiting factors include the increased computational cost of adding more statistics to overcome gauge noise, as well as suppressed overlap with the ground state of the boosted pion. Here we apply two noise reduction techniques, all-mode averaging (AMA) and momentum smearing, to the computation of $F_π(Q^2)$ at high momentum transfers using the Feynman-Hellmann (FH) theorem. First, we show that all-mode averaging by itself produces good improvement compared to previous results, at an equal computational cost. We also implement a momentum smearing technique to further reduce statistical uncertainties. In contrast to conventional smearing approaches, our Feynman-Hellmann method requires combining back-to-back momentum states, and hence we adapt a version of smearing involving a superposition of back-to-back smearing operations. This method is then implemented to compute $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$, demonstrating good improvement over the regular smeared counterpart. Finally both all-mode averaging and momentum smearing are combined to determine $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$ showing an excellent preliminary improvement over previous calculations."}

Challenges exist in encoding the minimal and physical degrees of freedom for a non-Abelian gauge theory and maintaining physical or gauge-invariant dynamics in a simulation. In this work, the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) formulation of the 1+1-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory is used to define an efficient mapping of SU(3) invariant degrees of freedom onto qubits. It is shown that the required number of qubits in the LSH basis is significantly reduced compared to its IRREP basis counterpart. While the non-Abelian Gauss laws of the SU(3) theory are automatically satisfied by the usage of LSH variables, the remnant constraints on the consistency of the flux numbers still exist. During time evolution, the noise can accumulate and take the state out of the sector of the Hilbert space where the constraint is satisfied. With this motivation, an oracle algorithm is constructed to be applied to the qubits for checking the local constraint at a given link.

Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved CGH in reconstructed quality and computational efficiency. However, deploying neural CGH pipelines directly on compact, eyeglass-style devices is hindered by stringent constraints on computation and energy consumption, while cloud offloading followed by transmission with natural image codecs often distorts phase information and requires high bandwidth to maintain reconstruction quality. Neural compression methods can reduce bandwidth but impose heavy neural decoders at the edge, increasing inference latency and hardware demand. In this work, we introduce JPEG-Inspired Cloud-Edge Holography, an efficient pipeline designed around a learnable transform codec that retains the block-structured and hardware-friendly nature of JPEG. Our system shifts all heavy neural processing to the cloud, while the edge device performs only lightweight decoding without any neural inference. To further improve throughput, we implement custom CUDA kernels for entropy coding on both cloud and edge. This design achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.15 dB at $<$ 2 bits per pixel with decode latency as low as 4.2 ms. Both numerical simulations and optical experiments confirm the high reconstruction quality of the holograms. By aligning CGH with a codec that preserves JPEG's structural efficiency while extending it with learnable components, our framework enables low-latency, bandwidth-efficient hologram streaming on resource-constrained wearable devices-using only simple block-based decoding readily supported by modern system-on-chips, without requiring neural decoders or specialized hardware."}

By using multiple spatial light modulator's phase patterns, PWI enhances Fisher information, boosting theoretical accuracy and regularizing the retrieval process effectively. In simulations, PWI approaches the theoretical phase error limit, and in experiments it reduces phase error by up to 1.6x compared to the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, achieving 1.8x higher resolution wavefront imaging in low photon regime.

Recently, PECD was explored with polarization-tailored light such as bi-chromatic and non-collinear drivers, which still produces significant chiral signals. Yet, all known PECD configurations to date exhibit non-zero time-local chirality. That is, they are driven by an intrinsically helical light source. Nonetheless, 'chiral' light can also be non-helical if its chirality manifests on longer timescales (e.g. an optical centrifuge). It remains unknown whether PECD can arise from non-helical coherent light. Here we predict that PECD indeed emerges from non-helical light by employing a train of linearly-polarized intense laser pulses with a rotating polarization axis, which are phase-coherent and time-delayed. We find strong PECD in the model chiral molecule CBrClFH under a wide parameter regime that can be optimized up to ~8% by tuning delays between pulses, suggesting quantum interference. We directly show that the physical mechanism for this type of PECD differs from the standard case, relying on a chiral hole attosecond wave-packet evolving in the molecule, induced by the first linear pulse. Our work shows that multiple mechanisms can give rise to PECD on longer timescales and provides a novel approach for ultrafast chirality spectroscopy and coherent chiral wave-packet manipulation."}

In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source, with the mean count rate modulated by incident radiation.

To enhance the generally weak nonlinearity, high-quality (Q) microcavities are commonly used to achieve practical efficiency.

We introduce METASTRINGS, a symbolic language for photonics that expresses nanostructures as textual sequences encoding materials, geometries, and lattice configurations. Analogous to molecular textual representations in chemistry, METASTRINGS provides a framework connecting human interpretability with computational design by capturing the structural hierarchy of photonic metasurfaces. Building on this representation, we develop Meta-GPT, a foundation transformer model trained on METASTRINGS and finetuned with physics-informed supervised, reinforcement, and chain-of-thought learning. Across various design tasks, the model achieves <3% mean-squared spectral error and maintains >98% syntactic validity, generating diverse metasurface prototypes whose experimentally measured optical responses match their target spectra. These results demonstrate that Meta-GPT can learn the compositional rules of light-matter interactions through METASTRINGS, laying a rigorous foundation for AI-driven photonics and representing an important step toward a metasurface genome project."}

In the experiment, we use two types of target patterns, intensity squared chaotic speckle and artificially designed sparse matrix, performing GI by holographic projection. Those imaging results show that the visibility of ghost image can be significantly improved whether the reference signal is the reconstruction pattern or the target pattern of computational holography. Furthermore, we realize positive and negative copies of ghost image by the aid of computational holography in which symmetrical target patterns are artificially designed. Thus, our study by means of computational holography not only presents a step toward meeting the visibility requirement for practical applications but also broadens the category of intensity correlation algorithm of classical light GI scheme."}

Typically, they exhibit eigenvalue splitting that scales as ε^(1/n), which is referred to as the generic response. However, under certain conditions, a nongeneric response of HOEPs occurs where the splitting follows a lower order ε^(1/m) (m<n). A nongeneric response of HOEPs with a lower order splitting lead to the remaining EPs. While the presence of these remaining EPs is acknowledged, a thorough elucidation of their fundamental properties has yet to be achieved. In this work, we demonstrate those unsplit eigenvalue points must constitute remaining EPs in a perturbed n-orders HOEPs system. Combining graph theory and topological analysis, the number and splitting order of the remaining EPs is studied. This framework not only resolves a fundamental challenge in HOEPs but also paves the way for exploiting remaining EPs in applications such as anisotropic sensing and the design of Dirac exceptional points."}

However, the current detection technique is mainly based on coherent laser sources. There is scarce mention of using partially coherent light sources, let alone sunlight. In this work, we collect sunlight and direct it into the laboratory, where it is modulated into a partially coherent probing source and then realize rotational Doppler shift detection. Our study reveals that in low-light conditions, where background noise is stronger than the signal, the superposition of rotational Doppler signals at different wavelengths can significantly enhance the signal strength and improve the signal-to-noise ratio, enabling accurate measurement of the rotational speed of objects. Our research provides experimental validation for the application of sunlight in rotational Doppler shift detection, demonstrating its potential value for passive remote sensing."}

Despite its advantages, the underlying fragmentation mechanisms, their connection to the nanoparticle size distribution, and the energy efficiency of the process remain poorly understood. In this study for the first time, microparticle fragmentation is investigated in single-pulse, single-particle experiments on Au microparticles. Determining the absorbed peak fluence enables assessment of the process energetics. Pump-probe microscopy identifies photomechanical fracture of the molten microparticle volume and photothermal phase explosion of its superheated surface as the fragmentation mechanisms. We find that 83% of the absorbed laser energy is converted into cavitation bubble formation, while only 1% contributes to the surface energy of the generated nanoparticles. Despite this small fraction, MP-LFL outperforms laser ablation in liquids. The surface energy generated per absorbed energy is 10 times higher, and the overall energy efficiency is 14 times higher. This gain originates from the confined microparticle geometry, which minimizes energy losses and enhances photomechanical fragmentation via pressure focusing. These results position microparticle fragmentation in liquids as a fundamentally more energy-efficient approach for scalable, laser-based nanoparticle production than laser ablation in liquids."}

Here, we introduce a reconfigurable plasmonic metasurface laser platform in which the lasing area geometry, and thus the emission properties, are dynamically programmed via spatially structured optical pumping. Using hexagonal arrays of silver nanoparticles embedded in dye-doped waveguides, we demonstrate lasing at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, including the K and M points. K-point lasing exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in relative intensity between degenerate K and K' modes, with no bias induced by pump geometry, even for geometries that explicitly break symmetry. In contrast, M-point lasing allows deterministic control over emission channels via asymmetric pumping. We further show that spatially separated K-point lasers synchronize in phase and amplitude, undergoing SSB in lockstep. A theoretical density matrix approach cast into stochastic differential equations reproduces the observed real- and Fourier-space intensity distributions and SSB behavior. Our findings establish spatially programmable metasurface lasers as a versatile platform for exploring dynamic phenomena in photonic lattices, with potential applications in vortex beam shaping, optical logic, and true random number generation."}

Yet, near their plasma frequency, conventional isotropic ENZ media remain highly absorptive, limiting nonlinear operations that require good transparency. Longitudinal epsilon near zero metamaterials (LENZ), characterized by a vanishing permittivity along the optical axis provide an exceptional platform for field enhancement while mitigating absorption losses and impedance mismatch. We experimentally show that a Si and ITO multilayer engineered for a LENZ resonance in the near-infrared enables broadband, high pump transmission while still harnessing ENZ enhanced nonlinearity to generate a strong third harmonic signal. This demonstrates that efficient nonlinear processes can be driven without the high-loss conditions typical of isotropic ENZ media and regardless of intrinsic absorption at the harmonic frequency. The resulting third harmonic efficiency is comparable to isotropic ENZ films but without the absorption-induced heating constraints of ENZ operation. The high pump transmission enables transparent LENZ (TLENZ) stacks to be integrated into optical cavities, where resonant field buildup could amplify the nonlinear response without compromising thermal management. These results establish TLENZ multilayers as a robust, versatile platform for transparent, field enhanced nonlinear nanophotonics, combining strong light matter interaction with low-loss operation."}

Recent studies in optics and photonics, including coherence tomography, Moire interference, and coherence-engineered diffraction, indicate that phase organization alone can bend light even without index discontinuities. Fraunhofer-based analyses further show that angular deflection can arise from intrinsic phase curvature within homogeneous media. Here we introduce a coherence-based constitutive framework that systematizes these observations: refraction can occur inside a bulk medium when coherence itself provides the effective boundary.\n  Two near-frequency structured beams write and probe a shared phase field, revealing reproducible angular rotation and coherence-lensing whose direction and magnitude follow the spectral detuning. The key detuning coefficient is:\n  Krc = 2 * pi * (1/lambda_r - 1/lambda_w).\n  The compact coherence-refraction relation\n  n2 * sin(theta_t) - n1 * sin(theta_i) = Krc_parallel / k0, with k0 = 2 * pi / lambda_r,\n  retains the form of Snell's law while extending it to coherence-driven regimes.

Here we present an integrated apparatus engineered specifically for high-accuracy, field-strength and orientation-dependent HHG measurements in bulk solids. The system incorporates dispersion-neutral intensity-control for few-cycle pulses, a vacuum HHG module with sub-micrometer and sub-degree sample positioning, and an imaging assembly that stabilizes the focal spot position and enables spatial filtering of the emitted harmonics. A synchronized dual-spectrometer scheme provides simultaneous UV/VUV and EUV radiation detection, while absolute electric field calibration is achieved through gas-phase attosecond streaking. Together, these capabilities establish a versatile and quantitatively reliable platform for solid-state HHG spectroscopy. The methodology is broadly adaptable to various laser sources and material classes, and supports future efforts aimed at reconstructing valence-electron potentials, tracking strong-field dynamics, and mapping electronic structure with sub-cycle temporal resolution."}

First, we show that the intensity at the output of a multiply scattering system can be described by a dyadic matrix, the optical-synaptic matrix, exhibiting the same form as a Hebbian synaptic matrix containing a single memory. Then, we employ emergent learning - an approach inspired by neuroscience - to exploit the vast dictionary of raw memories inherently available within a disordered optical structure, thereby engineering the optical-synaptic matrix to store a user-defined attractor, or tailored memory. Importantly these photonic structures also works as an optical comparators providing an intensity-based measure of the degree of similitude between a query pattern and the stored pattern, realizing an hardware co-localization between memory and optical operator. Our system has an almost infinite hardware capacity of tailored memories/ operators ($\\mathcal{M} \\sim 10^{60557}$), thus these tailored memories can be then employed as examples to build a classifier hardware based on intensity comparison without the need of additional digital transformation layers. Remarkably, this Photonic Emergent Learning platform is not only flexible and fabrication-free, but also relies primarily on analog processes, thus shifting the computational burden of training from the digital layers to the optical domain reducing the computational cost and enhancing performance."}

On the other hand, space-time wave packets are structured waves whose spatio-temporal spectra lie on tilted space-time planes, so their group velocity can be programmed, including superluminal values, even in a uniform medium. Here we develop a general theory of space-time refraction for such structured waves at a planar moving interface and show how a single boundary reshapes their velocity content. By identifying the invariants of a translating boundary, we obtain refraction laws for baseband, X-wave, and sideband packets that apply for arbitrary interface velocities and connect smoothly to static and purely temporal limits. These laws reveal regimes of \"space-time anomalous optical push broom,\" where a moving interface compresses a wide range of incident velocities into a narrow transmitted band, and \"velocity spectral optical fission,\" where an incident X-wave splits into two propagation-invariant branches with distinct velocities. The combined freedom to prepare waves with superluminal group velocity and to prescribe equally unconstrained interface speeds points toward reconfigurable time gating, optical buffering, velocity multiplexing, and controlled emission in moving media, and provides a route to photonic settings capable of emulating dynamical effects traditionally associated with gravitational or quantum processes."}
