Our supervised regression framework is trained on Wilson-clover ensembles with the Iwasaki gauge action, and we explore two input feature scenarios: one using $\\text{Tr}\\, M^{-1}$ and another relying solely on gauge observables (plaquette and rectangle), enabling a fully feature-based prediction pipeline. Using $\\text{Tr}\\, M^{-1}$ both as a physical input to cumulant construction and as a feature for predicting higher powers, we find that even with $\\sim1\\%$ labeled data, the resulting susceptibility, skewness, and kurtosis remain statistically consistent with fully measured baselines, reducing computational cost to about $26\\%$. In the feature-only approach, where correlations rather than explicit stochastic traces drive the predictions, bias correction plays a more pronounced role. We quantify this impact through multi ensemble reweighting across nearby quark masses.

We investigate the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and the four-fermion coupling, using the pseudoscalar condensate as an order parameter for the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity symmetry breaking phase. The universality classes of the phase boundaries are identified through the central charge $c$ obtained via scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extract the quantity related to the entanglement spectrum from the converged CTMRG environments, allowing us to distinguish the topological insulator phase and the trivial phase. The resulting phase structure suggests that the Aoki phase is separated from the other phases by critical lines characterized by $c=1/2$, while the critical lines with $c=1$ separate the topological insulating and trivial phases. Our numerical results also indicate that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime for the single-flavor theory."}

Here, we use nanophotonic structures, specifically micro-pillar and micro-disk resonators, to enhance optical collection and spin-readout. The micro-pillar geometry yields a 4-fold increase in photon collection, accompanied by a 2.4-fold reduction in spectral noise in optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. Consequently, the magnetic field sensitivity is improved by 24%. The large mode volume of the micro-disk supports resonances spanning 1150-1250 nm, enabling broadband coupling to nitrogen vacancy emission lines.

Unidirectional inter-modal scattering, enabled by either acousto-optic or electro-optic (EO) modulation, is a promising method in this category as it can directly modify optical dispersions and even enables linear non-reciprocal photonic devices in the strong coupling limit. While EO approaches are often preferred for their practicality, it is challenging to generate the large spatiotemporal momentum required for inter-modal phase matching without EO drive schemes involving multiple drive stimuli. Here, we demonstrate highly selective non-reciprocal inter-modal EO scattering enabled by a single high-index radiofrequency (RF) traveling wave stimulus. Our experimental demonstration is performed on a thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonics platform, in which we engineer a slow-wave radiofrequency (SWRF) transmission line with an effective RF index > 9 that natively generates the required RF momentum while simultaneously maintaining strong RF-optical mode overlap. By additionally engineering the interaction length, we achieve a directional ~20 dB non-reciprocal scattering contrast. The SWRF architecture provides a scalable route to magnetic-free non-reciprocity and establishes momentum-engineered RF waves as a powerful tool for next-generation, fully integrated non-reciprocal photonic systems."}

The hologram is designed by embedding the transmission function of a binary PRG into the phase argument of the cosine term(s) of an amplitude linear grating. When illuminated with a plane wave, this hologram generates RCBs in the non-zero diffraction orders, and when illuminated with a Gaussian beam, it generates RCB-like patterns at specific propagation distances. This method entirely eliminates the need for complex and expensive spatial light modulators (SLMs). The study presents a theory of diffraction for plane and Gaussian beams from such holograms, including a specific theoretical treatment of Gaussian beam diffraction from PRGs. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we demonstrate how different RCBs can be generated at different diffraction orders due to the phase-amplitude enhancement resulting from multiplying the diffraction order number by the phase amplitude of the embedded base PRG, when the illuminating beam is a plane wave. For the Gaussian beam case, we show how different RCB-like patterns can be generated at different diffraction orders for the same reason, though only at specific propagation distances. Experimental and numerical results indicate that this technique yields RCBs and RCB-like patterns with approximately five times the useful power of their SLM-generated counterparts, demonstrating significantly higher power efficiency. This advantage renders the proposed method highly suitable for applications such as multiple optical trapping and free-space optical communication."}

At the heart of modern telecommunication, lay optical interconnects allowing for large data transfer capabilities via optical fibers.

In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of integrated III-V heterostructures operating at cryogenic temperatures down to 5K. Using an integrated n-InP/i-InGaAs/p-InP/p-InGaAs stack monolithically grown on silicon, we identify a temperature-dependent current-lowering mechanism arising from trap states becoming increasingly active below 140K. We demonstrate for the first time that these traps can be equivalently excited and controlled through either thermal or optical energy, revealing a dual modulation mechanism. These findings provide new insights into carrier transport and defect behavior in III-V heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures, advancing the field of cryogenic photonics and offering a non-destructive approach for identifying and characterizing material impurities in integrated quantum and optoelectronic devices."}

The metasurface consists of a square array of Mie-resonant elliptical a-Si:H dimers situated on an SiO$_2$ substrate and embedded in a PMMA film containing Eu(TTA)$_3$. Based on reciprocity principle, it was designed to achieve maximum electric (magnetic) field enhancement in the dimer gap at 610 nm (590 nm) for $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) normally incident light in order to selectively enhance the electric dipole (magnetic dipole) emission into the $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) emission channel, respectively. Momentum-resolved spectroscopy and back-focal plane imaging of emission of the fabricated light-emitting metasurface clearly reveal the intended polarization-dependent emission behaviour, with the $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) emission showing a reduced (enhanced) ratio of the magnetic-/electric dipole emission intensity, correspondingly where the magnetic dipole emission is enhanced with a magnetic field enhancement from the nanostructures.

Suitably designed photonic structures give rise to flat (dispersionless) bands, where the density of states diverges, and group velocity goes to zero, allowing light localization. These properties make flat bands attractive for lasing; however, designing photonic structures supporting flat bands suitable for lasing is challenging. Here, we introduce nanoparticle chain lattices. These chain geometries provide long-range coupled systems that support, at predictable wavelengths, bands that are totally flat and extend over the full angular range. We demonstrate lasing in the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode of single chains of nanoparticles and explain the transition from flat band lasing to the single-mode normal-incidence (Gamma-point) lasing as the number of chains is increased. Moreover, we show partially coherent emission from square and triangular two-dimensional chain lattices. The excited modes depend on the pump power and polarization. Our results establish chain lattices as a versatile platform for exploring flat band lasing and suggest new routes toward narrowband, linearly polarized, and bright light sources with tailored coherence."}

Certain lattice geometries exhibit dispersionless flat bands, characterized by vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states, which present unique opportunities for applications such as slow light, nonlinear optical processes and controlling photoluminescence. However, thus far, flat bands have not been reported in systems where the lattice sites are radiatively coupled over a long range. Here we show that lattices consisting of superposed equispaced one dimensional chains exhibit flat bands with a purely diffractive origin, with the energies and angles of the flat bands controlled by the geometrical parameters of the lattice and the unit cell. The flat bands extend over all angles, can have linewidths on the order of a few nanometers, and are linearly polarized. We experimentally observe flat bands at predicted energies in lattices of gold nanoparticles at near-infrared frequencies using Fourier spectroscopy. Our results provide a general and efficient design strategy for lattices with flat, polarized dispersions for applications such as flat-band lasing, enhancing light-matter interaction, and controlling the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation over a wide spectral range."}
