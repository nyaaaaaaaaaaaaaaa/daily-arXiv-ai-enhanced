The photon either reaches the boundary for a first passage or is absorbed. Projecting the walk onto the axial direction produces a one-dimensional alternating process whose peaks and valleys correspond to changes in the sign of the projected step. This reduction preserves first-return and first-passage events and leads to a representation in terms of Motzkin-type polynomials. The analytical formulation is complete except for boundary-constrained return terms, which appear as high-order integrals. We treat these contributions with a single truncation factor determined from Monte Carlo simulations of first-return distributions over a wide range of anisotropy g and scattering steps ms. The resulting factor follows a Cauchy distribution. Incorporating it yields first-return probabilities in agreement with full three-dimensional Monte Carlo to within 2% for g<=0.7. The approach gives backscattering coefficients from phase-function integrals and provides an efficient alternative to full three-dimensional simulations for problems of radiative transport in semi-infinite media."}

Among available microcomb generation methods, hybrid cavities uniquely co-locate gain and Kerr dynamics, where the lasing mode directly resonates in the nonlinear microcavity, simultaneously enabling self-sustained and highly efficient microcomb generation. However, their implementation is often limited by partial integration or the need for external injection, which complicates operation architecture, raises power and hampers system miniaturization. In this work, we present a fully integrated hybrid cavity for self-sustained microcomb generation, relying solely on the co-oscillation of lasing and Kerr nonlinearity without external driving. The system collapses the pump laser, nonlinear resonator and feedback loops into a minimalist on-chip two-element cavity, consisting of a high-Q microresonator with engineered intracavity reflection and a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA). The scheme delivers self-starting operation and stable performance without active feedback. The generated coherent microcomb achieves intrinsic linewidths below 1 kHz and integrated linewidths around 100 kHz, with self-sustained operation exceeding 24 hours. This ultra-compact architecture provides a practical path toward scalable, coherent multi-wavelength sources for integrated photonic systems."}

Here, we report the strongly enhanced optical nonlinearity for their typical representative high quality TiN epitaxial films with thicknesses down to a few nanometers. Systematic Z_scan measurements reveal a pronounced increase in nonlinear absorption with decreasing thickness. Especially in the ENZ spectral region, the TD TiN films exhibit nearly two orders of magnitude stronger nonlinear absorption over a broad range of incidence angles as compared to conventional thin films. The enhanced nonlinear absorption observed is well described by a nonlinear nonlocal electromagnetic response model that accounts for electron confinement effects unique to the TD plasmonic systems. Comparison with Ti1_xAlxN highlights the necessity of low-loss ENZ response for nonlinear enhancement. These findings identify TiN and similar TD plasmonic systems as a robust refractory platform for exploiting ENZ mediated nonlinear processes in ultrathin photonic material structures."}

However, conventional approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in imaginary time are limited, as they do not allow real time evolution and suffer from a sign problem in many important cases. Using Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) as a variational ground state ansatz offers an alternative for studying LGTs through a sign-problem-free variational MC. As this method is extended to larger and more complex systems, understanding its numerical behavior becomes essential. While conventional action based MC has been extensively studied, the performance and characteristics of non-action-based MC within the GGFPEPS framework are far less explored. In this work, we investigate these algorithmic aspects, identifying an optimal update size for GGFPEPS-based MC simulations for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ in $2+1$ dimensions. We show that gauge fixing generally slows convergence, and demonstrate that not exploiting the translation-invariance can, in some cases, improve the computational time scaling of error convergence. We expect that these improvements will allow advancing the simulation to larger and more complex systems."}

However, multiple scattering in turbid media distorts their phase and amplitude, complicating the retrieval of topological charge. We introduce VortexNet, a deep learning architecture that integrates an Angular Fourier Transform to explicitly extract rotational symmetries of OAM beams from experimentally acquired intensity and interference patterns. By transforming spatial information into the angular frequency domain, VortexNet isolates azimuthal features that persist despite scattering, enabling accurate topological charge classification even in complex optical environments. The results reveal that OAM-specific angular correlations can survive multiple scattering and be decoded through angular-domain learning. This establishes a new paradigm for structured-light analysis in complex medium, where deep learning enables the recovery of topological information beyond the reach of classical optics, paving the way for resilient photonic systems in communication, sensing, and imaging."}

However, such control is typically limited to magnetization transverse to light's polarization plane, or out-of-plane magnetism in 2D materials, while in-plane magnetic moments have remained largely unexplored. This is due to the difficulty of generating electronic orbital angular momentum components within light's polarization plane. Here we overcome this limitation, demonstrating complete three-dimensional, all-optical control of magnetism in 2D materials. Using first-principles simulations, we show that a tailored, two-color laser field can induce and steer magnetic moments in any direction with the relative angle between the laser polarizations playing a key parameter in coherent control. We analyze the physical mechanism of this process and show that it arises from a simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries in the two-color laser. In-plane orbital moments are introduced via non-zero out-of-plane longitudinal photogalvanic currents enabled by broken inversion and mirror symmetries, while time-reversal symmetry breaking enables build-up of spin-rotation processes through spin-orbit coupling, translating the orbital moments to transient magnetism. Our findings demonstrate a full 3D coherent control scheme for transient magnetic states on femtosecond timescales driven by tailored lasers, and can be used to develop novel spectroscopies for magnetism, all-optical magnetic switching for ultrafast spintronics, and novel information storage capabilities."}

This gives rise to wave-vector dependent eigenstates of elliptical, linear and circular polarizations. In particular, fully circular polarization states are not only present at a single point in momentum-space (k-space), but along a line. This circular polarization line, as well as a linear polarization line, emanates from a polarization degeneracy at the Dirac point.

While such dielectric material has an extremely low second order nonlinear susceptibility, we observe 105-fold boosting in the nonlinear SHG process mainly due to the surface nonlinear susceptibility of the gold metal aided by the significant electric field enhancement that occurs in the nanogaps due to the formed nanocavity resonance.

However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation. We achieve a setup noise floor below $1\\text{ pm}\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ across most of the LISA measurement band, and provide an understanding of the current technical limitations. With this low-noise baseline, we measured the performance of the three Backlink implementations under non-rotational conditions.

This enabled us to conduct a preliminary study of the Backlink inherent noise, where we emphasized on the backscatter noise intrinsic to a straightforward fiber-based Backlink, as this is the current baseline for LISA."}

Efficient input coupling and controlled excitation of the fundamental supermodes of the dual-core waveguide is provided with adiabatic tapers and a dual-prong input structure. For the dual-core waveguide, the short-wavelength dispersive wave is located at 540~nm (green, 555~THz), which is blue-shifted by 80~nm (70~THz) compared to that of the single-core waveguide. Simultaneously, the dual-core waveguide generates broadband radiation spanning from the blue into the UV range, reaching to below 350~nm (above 855~THz), with typically a spectral density 25~dB below that of the dispersive wave. The broadband component can be addressed to third harmonic generation and is not observed in single-core supercontinuum generation.

There is a significant research interest in controlling and enhancing the photonic SHE. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the microwave field control of the photonic SHE in a closed-loop $Λ$-type atomic system. We demonstrate that both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE can be controlled by varying the relative phase $φ$ between the driving optical fields and the strength of the microwave coupling $Ω_μ$. At zero probe field detuning ($Δ_p = 0$) and $φ=0,π$, the photonic SHE magnitude reaches to upper limit equal to the half of the incident beam waist, and remains largely unaffected by the microwave strength $Ω_μ$, but its angular position shifts linearly with increasing $Ω_μ$. At intermediate phases, especially at $φ= π/2$, the magnitude of the photonic SHE exponentially decreases with the increase of $Ω_μ$. Interestingly, we observed microwave-controlled switching of photonic SHE by tuning the relative phase $φ$ at an optimized value of $Ω_μ$ and $Ω_{c}$. In contrast, at $Δ_p = \\pm Ω_c$, a maximum photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist occurs at $φ\\leq π$ and $Ω_μ \\geq Ω_p$, where both real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility vanish, yielding a unit refractive index.

Depending on the symmetry and dimensionality of the bulk systems, different edge states emulating soliton, quantum integer and quantum spin Hall effects have been realized. A major concern in photonics is how one can shape the strength and polarisation of electromagnetic fields to suit different applications. Here, we show zero-dimensional (0D) interface state arising from one-dimensional (1D) dissipative topological photonic crystals exhibit strong field localisation and spin-momentum locking thanks to its complex classical analogue Dirac mass parameter. By using spatiotemporal coupled mode theory to formulate 1D photonic crystals and their corresponding Jackiw Rebbi-like (JR) interface state, we find the interaction between two energy bands at high symmetry points plays a major role in defining not only the topological triviality of the crystals but also its complex Dirac mass parameter. More importantly, when two topological trivial and nontrivial bulk systems are brought together to form a JR state, while the real part of the Dirac mass parameter governs the spectral and spatial field localisations of the interface state, the imaginary part gives rise to a net flow of energy towards the interface and a transverse spin angular momentum, resulting in a strong spin-momentum locking. We verify our theory by 1D plasmonic crystals using finite-difference time-domain simulations as well as far-field angle-resolved spectroscopy and imaging."}
