However, scaling their power and energy while preserving complex phase and spatial structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we demonstrate coherent beam combining as a versatile and scalable method for generating high-power structured beams without limitations on topological charge or spatial structure, while maintaining exceptionally high modal purity. We experimentally implement coherent beam combining for optical vortex beams with topological charges l = 1, 5, and 8, achieving a combined average power of 100 W and a peak power of 100 kW, with combining efficiencies of 95.0%, 93.9%, and 91.2%, respectively. Off-axis digital holography confirms that the phase and intensity profiles of the combined beams retain high modal purity, even at high topological charges. These results establish coherent beam combining as an effective route to high modal purity structured light at high power levels, unlocking new opportunities for advanced photonics and high-intensity light-matter interaction studies."}

These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use."}

While there have been many approaches to such integration, the general reliance on traditional glass vapor cells, distilled alkali metals, and epoxy sealing limits reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, mitigating adverse Rb-photonics interactions is essential, particularly as devices become more compact and the alkali source lies in close proximity to the photonic elements. Here, we demonstrate the successful operation of compact and fully integrated devices that combine silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with microfabricated borosilicate vapor cells and pill-type rubidium (Rb) dispensers through hermetic seals via anodic bonding. We show how successful operation hinges on optically activating the dispenser in a low-power pulsed mode, releasing controlled amounts of Rb vapor on demand while mitigating photonic degradation. Simultaneously, a counter-propagating desorption laser completely suppresses Rb-induced losses and enables waveguide-based atomic vapor spectroscopy. Using this approach, we demonstrate repeatable control of vapor density by tuning activation pulse length, duty cycle, and device temperature. These results establish a compact, manufacturable, and scalable vapor-PIC device, and set the stage for future demonstrations in cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum nonlinear optics, and chip-scale atomic sensors."}

Designing metaplatforms to enhance chiroptical signals under linearly polarized excitation is particularly appealing due to the minimal chiral background and the ease of controlling excitation polarization. Here, a novel two-step inverse design scheme for dielectric lossless metasurfaces with superchiral hot spots is proposed. The method extends the local density of field enhancements for non-chiral fields into the chiral regime and significantly surpasses previous enhancements in super-chiral field generation. It has been demonstrated that by leveraging the excitation of high quality factor modes with small mode volumes, it is theoretically possible to convert linearly polarized plane waves into a superchiral hot spot with record-high enhancement in the near-field optical chirality up to 104. A prototype is successfully implemented using advanced nanofabrication technologies. The optical characterization of the prototype demonstrates a 102-fold enhancement in optical chirality. The findings of this study unveil novel prospects for chiral spectroscopy with ultra-compact devices, underscoring the role of machine learning and physics-based inverse design in the development of cutting-edge, functional photonic structures."}

In this work, we demonstrate a technique for extracting dynamic 1D images of the average unit cell in a periodic sample from traditional EUV scatterometry data by analyzing the changing intensities of the far field diffracted orders. Starting from a system of equations relating small changes in far field diffraction to phase and amplitude perturbations at the sample plane, it is shown that under certain conditions, changes to the $n$th diffracted order map exclusively onto the $n$th Fourier component of the perturbation via a closed-form relation. We show through rigorous coupled-wave analysis simulations that our method can provide a good approximation even outside the scalar diffraction theory framework in which it is derived. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate this reconstruction method by exiting 1D nickel nanowires on a diamond substrate using an infrared laser pump pulse, and measuring their relaxation using a time-delayed EUV probe pulse, to visualize nanoscale phonon dynamics."}

This architectural breakthrough simultaneously enables a much smaller device footprint and an extended low-V$π$ bandwidth, without relying on narrowband resonances. Building on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate both a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a cascaded PM, and verify their versatility in finite impulse response (FIR) filtering and optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. The recirculating MZM operates as a 4-tap rectangular-window FIR filter with 110 GHz bandwidth in a compact 2.889$\\times$0.58 mm$^2$ footprint. The cascaded PM achieves a 3.40 GHz low-V$π$ bandwidth, a 110 GHz resonant EO bandwidth, and a V$π$L of 0.7 V$\\cdot$cm, and generates 20 OFC lines under a 33 dBm microwave drive.

Analytic continuation of this dispersion relation to $ν= -1$ yields a formal zero-frequency endpoint where $j_{-1}(x) = \\cos x / x$ admits the root $x = 0$. We examine this limit in detail, showing that while the mathematics is well-defined, the endpoint does not correspond to a physical electromagnetic mode. The positivity of the angular Sturm-Liouville operator restricts physical eigenvalues to $ν\\geq 0$, placing $ν= -1$ outside the admissible spectrum. We demonstrate that all electromagnetic field components vanish in this limit, even though the underlying Debye potential $Π= \\cos(kr)/kr$ remains non-trivial and exhibits a monopole-type singularity at the origin. This distinction between potential and field reflects the kernel structure of the curl-curl operator for spherically symmetric configurations. The analysis clarifies the boundary between propagating electromagnetic modes and static field configurations in spherical geometry, connecting the formal endpoint to longstanding questions about mode counting in cavity quantization."}

Moreover, by adapting the training technique to the forward-forward approach, a marginal drop of 1% is recorded compared to the backpropagation scenario, thus showcasing the compatibility of the overall architecture with a hardware-friendly training approach. Finally, we experimentally implement the trained kernels using a programmable waveshaper. Despite the difference between the simulated and experimentally generated transfer functions of the programmable kernels, the classification accuracy based on the experimentally obtained kernels exhibits a marginal 0.2% reduction, proving the validity of the idea and its high robustness to variations of the frequency-applied complex weights."}
