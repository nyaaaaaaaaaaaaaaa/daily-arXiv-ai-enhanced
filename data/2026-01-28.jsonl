This quantity is directly related to the confining mechanism which generates the flux tube and can be used to test its properties. We study a wide range of different values of lattice spacing, temperature and flux tube lengths and show that our data are precise enough to distinguish between different confining models. In particular we show that at high temperatures (just below the deconfinement transition) the data are perfectly described by an Ising-like effective model based on the Svetitsky-Yaffe mapping. At lower temperatures this approximation does not hold anymore. In this regime (which is the most interesting one from a physical point of view) we test several alternative proposals and show that the dual superconductor model is the one which better fits the data. However, this proposal is not fully satisfactory, because the values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter extracted from the fits increase with the length of the flux tube, which is not a feature predicted by the model. This suggests that a more sophisticated model is needed to explain confinement in non-abelian gauge theories and, at the same time, that our data on the intrinsic width may be a powerful tool to benchmark these candidates."}

The most common scenario deals with particles that tend to be centered on the brightest part of the optical trap. Consequently, the optical forces keep the particle away from the dark zones of the beam. However, this is not the case when a focused doughnut_shaped beam generates on_axis trapping. In this system, the particle is centered on the intensity minima of the laser beam and the bright annular part lies on the periphery of the particle. Researchers have shown great interest in this phenomenon due to its advantage of reducing light interaction with trapped particles and the intriguing increase in the trapping strength. This work presents experimental and theoretical results that extend the analysis of on_axis trapping with light vortex beams. Specifically, in our experiments, we trap micron_sized spherical silica (SiO2) particles in water and we measure, through the power spectrum density method, the trap stiffness constant \\k{appa} generated by vortex beams with different topological charge orders. The optical forces are calculated from the exact solutions of the electromagnetic fields provided by the generalized Lorentz_Mie theory. We show a remarkable agreement between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurements of \\k{appa}. Moreover, our numerical model gives us information about the electromagnetic fields inside the particle, offering valuable insights into the influence of the electromagnetic fields present in the vortex beam trapping scenario."}

However, in 2D static tight-binding systems, perfectly flat bands can only exist in the topologically trivial phase, as characterized by a zero Chern number. Here we show that by introducing periodic driving into a 2D photonic Lieb lattice composed of coupled microring resonators, the resulting Floquet topological insulator can host perfectly flat bands with nontrivial topology. In particular, by tracking the evolution of the flat-band modes over each cycle, we show that the non-Abelian displacements of the flat-band modes are characterized by a nontrivial quantized helicity even though the quasi-energy bands have zero Chern number. The helical motion of the flat-band modes can be described by a braiding of the world lines of their trajectories, with a nontrivial winding number directly connected to the helicity. We also propose a scheme to experimentally measure the quantized non-Abelian helicity in a microring lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. These results suggest that Floquet topological photonic insulators based on coupled microring resonators can provide a versatile platform for investigating non-Abelian topological physics and strongly correlated phenomena in photonic flat-band systems."}

Here, we report a biocompatible and structurally robust PDRC system integrated onto a commercial rapid-curing fiberglass cast, a conformal substrate widely used in orthopedic and industrial applications. The cooling architecture adopts a bilayer polymer design consisting of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) adhesion layer and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer, both embedded with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) ceramic particles derived from processed animal bone waste. The bio-derived CPP simultaneously enables broadband solar scattering and high mid-infrared emittance, while offering sustainability and biocompatibility advantages. The resulting composite exhibits over 90% solar reflectance and achieves up to 15 C sub-ambient cooling under direct outdoor sunlight."}

Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes."}

Engineering the photonic environment surrounding quantum emitters can enhance their emission characteristics. However, simultaneously achieving precise control over both excitation enhancement and quantum-yield modulation at the nanoscale remains elusive, highlighting substantial room for advancing the precised engineering of quantum emission. Here, we introduce silicon Mie voids - air-defined cavities that invert the conventional solid-particle geometry - to achieve independent tuning of quantum emission within an individual subwavelength structure, while minimizing optical losses. Full-wave simulations and experiments on both gradient and uniform Mie-void arrays jointly validate this quantitative framework for emission tuning, which disentangles excitation enhancement arising from local field confinement in air and quantum-yield enhancement resulting from strengthened emitter-resonator coupling, while confirming the accelerated radiative decay enabled by the void configuration. Leveraging this flexible mechanism, we realize a bimodal nanophotonic pattern with near-diffraction-limited pixels that encode the EPFL logo in the bright field and the SJTU logo in both dark field and photoluminescence micrographs. These results establish Mie voids as a powerful platform for programmable, high-density multimodal displays and open new avenues for advancing state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices."}

To achieve the desired effect, each individual laser pulse must be delivered correctly. Laser Shock Peening quality is typically verified by destructive and time-consuming residual stress measurements or by subjective operator judgement, which is non-objective and unsuitable for continuous in-line control. We propose a simple, low-cost and robust method based on the analysis of the acoustic response that automatically classifies individual laser pulses as defect-free or defective. We show that the acoustic response captured by a low-cost microphone carries sufficiently informative signatures to reliably distinguish correct from incorrect impacts and enables quality control at the level of single pulses. The method provides a non-destructive and objective route to real-time monitoring of Laser Shock Peening, with the potential to increase process reliability and support industrial deployment of this technology without the need for subsequent destructive measurements."}

While mechanical modulation provides a potential solution, current implementations generally lack inherent state-locking capability, rendering them vulnerable to environmental disturbances and actuation errors. Inspired by the concept of mechanical bits (MBs), this paper presents a self-locking non-volatile coding metasurface platform enabled by Kresling origami-based MBs, where the continuous mechanical deformation of individual meta-atoms is discretized into robust binary geometric states protected by intrinsic energy barriers. The bistable states are strictly mapped to 1-bit EM coding phases via tailored metallic patterns integrated onto a multimaterial 3D printed Kresling origami array. Building upon this concept, both transmission- and reflection-type prototypes are proposed and experimentally demonstrated, exhibiting exceptional wavefront manipulation capabilities through near-field holographic imaging and far-field beam steering. In addition, the lightweight origami unit (1.5 g) exhibits an exceptional load-bearing capacity, supporting over 100 times its own weight. These results bridge mechanical logic with EM information processing, establishing a universal physical paradigm for constructing low-power, highly robust coding metasurfaces resilient to extreme environments."}

Here, we introduce a theoretical and computational framework to investigate core-double-shell nanoparticles and their asymmetric version, the iris-gated core-double-shell architecture. The optical response of the structures is first evaluated using generalized Mie theory and subsequently validated through FEM and FDTD simulations, ensuring a consistent description of their electromagnetic and thermal behavior. To systematically map the space of variables, we defined a multi-objective figure of merit that integrates absorption efficiency, absorption cross section, and polymer-layer thickness. Furthermore, we define a thermal gain parameter that quantifies energy densification and complements the analysis of thermal directionality. Our results reveal a near-optimal configuration with parameters ($r_c$, $δ_{Au}$, $δ_p$, $θ$)=(36 nm, 5 nm, 40 nm, 70$°$), capable of producing a temperature rise of 20-23 $°$C, with 67% of the thermal fluz directed toward the upper hemispace and yielding 50% focusing enhancement relative to the symmetric case.

However, direct measurements at the fabrication level provide limited knowledge, whether through destructive cross-section imaging or non-destructive ellipsometry, while complete optical characterization that enables precise dispersion metrology is time-consuming and poorly suited for mass-scale foundry fabrication. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework to solve three complementary problems: (i) predicting resonator geometric dimensions, (ii) identifying the correct material dispersion, and last, but not least, (iii) precisely reconstructing the integrated dispersion spectrum directly from ring dimensions. These three neural networks together enable both inverse and forward characterization of microring resonators. Using numerically generated datasets based on Sellmeier-type material models, we demonstrate <1 nm ring dimension prediction accuracy without noise, <8 nm prediction accuracy with ~45 dispersion samples under a realistic frequency measurement noise level (50 MHz), and ~16 nm prediction accuracy at a higher noise level (200 MHz). The Sellmeier model classification exceeds 99% accuracy in all cases. Importantly, dispersion sampled far from the pump resonances proves most informative, reducing full-spectrum characterization requirements. The forward-prediction network reconstructs dispersion spectra from the ring dimensions with high accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of machine learning applied to dispersion data as a rapid, non-destructive tool for wafer-scale quality control and process monitoring in photonic foundries."}

In large gas lasers, however, the frequency spacing between longitudinal modes of the resonator easily becomes significantly smaller than the Doppler-broadened width of the gain profile.

Such unstable operation cannot be tolerated in metrological or sensing applications, such as ring laser gyroscopes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method to establish stable operation on a chosen mode index by optically steering the ring laser to a desired mode index through injection locking with an external laser. The injected mode reliably follows the external steering. Intra-cavity backscattering can even cause the counter-propagating, non-injected mode to follow the external steering as well."}
