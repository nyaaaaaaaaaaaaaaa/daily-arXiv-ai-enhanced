First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have\nmostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs).

Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time\nstring dynamics of a $2\\!+\\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter.\nIn the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through\nsharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a\ndistinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a\n\\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from\nresonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball\nloops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with\ndistinct dynamics.

Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the\nepsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence\nlifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a\nrelative emission cone narrowing from 17.6{\\deg} to 10.3{\\deg}. These results\nunderline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the\nspectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the\npotential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration\ninto next-generation quantum photonic devices. Due to their CMOS compatibility,\nfabrication tunability, and high thermal and optical damage thresholds, TCO NZI\nmaterials offer a robust platform for scalable and high-performance quantum\noptical systems operating within the telecom bandwidth."}

Yet,\nintriguing special cases exist in which the output wavefront is \"frozen\"\n(agnostic to the input wavefront). This happens when special structure in the\ncomplex medium collapses the rank of its transmission matrix to unity. Here, we\nunveil that an analogous phenomenon exists more universally for differential\nscattering (including reflection) in reconfigurable complex media.\nSpecifically, for a localized perturbation, the differential scattering matrix\nof any complex medium has rank one. One consequence is that the differential\noutput signal is perfectly coherent irrespective of the input wavefront's\ncoherence. Moreover, the thermal noise emitted into the frozen differential\noutput mode has a particular structure that can be exploited for thermal noise\nmanagement. We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a\nrich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom. Then,\nwe demonstrate \"customized freezing\" by optimizing the configuration of\nadditional programmable meta-atoms that parametrize the wireless link, as\nenvisioned for 6G networks. We impose particular shapes of the frozen\ndifferential output mode, and maximize its signal-to-thermal-noise ratio.\nPotential applications include filtering and stabilization of differential\nwavefronts, as well as imaging, sensing, and communication in complex media."}

These\ngeometrical figures are studied here using catastrophe theory. The application\nof this geometrical theory to our optical situation has enabled us to\nanalytically reproduce the behaviours of various caustics. The interest lies\nmainly in the universal nature of these results since our treatment requires no\nprior knowledge of the optical configuration, but only a smart definition of\nthe control space. This universal approach has finally made it possible to\nextract mathematical relationships between the aberration coefficients of any\noptical system, which were hidden by the complexity of optical trajectories but\nrevealed by the set of catastrophes in the control space. These results provide\na glimpse for future applications of caustics in the development of new\ncorrected optical systems, especially for ions-based devices."}

Quantum annealers, like D-Wave's cryogenic\nhardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of\nqubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs.\nHere, we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic\noscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin\nrepresentation. Inspired by Hopfield networks, our architecture solves\nfully-connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings), and $>$41,000\nspins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system leverages cascaded thin-film\nlithium niobate modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier, and a digital\nsignal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating\npotential $>$200 giga-operations per second for spin coupling and nonlinearity.\nThis platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic\nIsing machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate\nbest-in-class solution quality for Max-Cut problems of arbitrary graph\ntopologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain\nground-state solutions for number partitioning and lattice protein folding -\nbenchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system leverages\ninherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate\nconvergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP - traditionally used in\noptical communications - within optical computation enhances convergence and\nsolution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for\noptimization, neuromorphic processing, and analog AI."}
