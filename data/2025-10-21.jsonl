Salter"], "title": "Laser written waveguides to the sample edge", "comment": null, "summary": "A method is presented for fabrication of femtosecond laser written waveguides\nin glass to remove the need for polishing of substrates after processing. It is\nshown that by amplitude masking the fabrication laser beam near the sample edge\nand increasing the pulse energy it is possible to write waveguides that are not\naffected by edge aberrations and display mode profiles well matched to single\nmode fibre. Results are presented for different depths in fused silica and\nborosilicate glass substrates. The transmission from fibre to photonic circuit\nis significantly improved for situations where it is not possible to polish\nglass substrates after laser writing, creating new opportunities in photonic\npackaging."}

These systems are very well suited for inertial\nsensing, as the particles are isolated from the environment when they are\nlevitated at low pressures. However, there are many challenges in the\nexperimental realization that may affect the performance of these systems. For\nexample, optical aberrations in the wavefront of the trapping laser which arise\nfrom optical elements or misalignment have a great impact on the trapping\npotential. The detrimental effect of optical aberrations has not been\nthoroughly studied, and usually they are iteratively corrected, giving some\nconflicting results depending on the figures of merit that are used. In this\nwork, we present a thorough study of the effects of structuring the wavefront\nof the trapping beams. We observe that clean beams, i.e. highly focused beams\nwith unaberrated wavefronts, may be used to optimize the longitudinal\nfrequencies, at the cost of the transversal ones. Our work is based in a\ncombination of experimental studies using a complete basis of orthogonal\npolynomials (Zernike polynomials) to control the wavefront and a set of\nnumerical calculations, which allow us to compare the impact of structured\nwavefronts on the quality of traps for optically levitated particles in vacuum.\nThis will have direct applications in quantum sensing and fundamental studies\nof quantum mechanics, as it allows the reduction of optical backaction and\nthermal decoherence of the particles."}

A classification of surplus-response variables through tolerance\nmanipulation was included to unravel the dimensional aspect of the data.\nSimilarly, the impact of the exclusion of supererogatory variables through the\nidentification of clustering movements of constituents is examined. The method\nof constructing a spectrum of collaborative results through the application of\nsimilar techniques has been tested. To evaluate the suitability of each\nstatistical method before its application on a large dataset, a selection of ML\nschemes has been proposed. The supervised learning tools principal component\nanalysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), and hierarchical clustering (HC) were\nemployed to define the elemental characteristics of Zernike variables. PCA\nenabled to reduce the dimensionality of the system by identifying two principal\ncomponents which collectively account for 95\\% of the total variance. The\nexecution of FA indicated that a specific tolerance of independent variability\nof 0.005 could be used to reduce the dimensionality of the system without\nlosing essential data information. A high cophenetic coefficient value of\nc=0.9629 validated an accurate clustering division of variables with similar\ncharacteristics. The current approach of mutually validating ML and statistical\nanalysis methods will aid in laying the foundation for state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nanalysis. The benefit of our approach can be assessed by considering that the\nassociated SOTA will enhance the predictive accuracy between two comparable\nmethods, in contrast to the SOTA analysis conducted between two arbitrary ML\nmethods."}

We introduce the concept of the\nCircular Huygens Dipole and numerically demonstrate its realization in a single\nSi nanocuboid. We show that the polarization of an incident linear wave\ncontrols the interference between co-located circular electric and magnetic\ndipoles excited in phase quadrature. This enables deterministic switching of\nthe forward-scattered radiation between purely right- and left-circularly\npolarized states. The system also functions as a directional spin-to-linear\npolarization converter.
