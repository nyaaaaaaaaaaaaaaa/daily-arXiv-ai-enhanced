However, conventional\nsimulation techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM) and\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD), face challenges in accurately modeling\nTHz wave propagation. These difficulties arise from the broad operating\nbandwidth of THz-TDS (~0.1-10 THz), which demands extremely high temporal\nresolution to capture pulse dynamics and fine spatial resolution to resolve\nmicrostructures and interface effects. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into THz-TDS modeling for\nthe first time. Through a comprehensive analysis of forward problems in the\ntime domain, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of PINNs as a\npowerful framework for advancing THz wave simulation and analysis."}

Electronic-photonic\nintegrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for\nnext-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high\nbandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and\ninterconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for\nsustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and\nlower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon\nfootprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,\nwhile delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and\ninterconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI\nsystems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and\ncross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We\npresent how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing\nboth chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer\ndevice-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for\nphotonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip\narea cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI\nworkloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by\ntolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with\nEPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and\nrobustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI\nsystems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously\nmeet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for\nsustainable computing."}

We compare\nthe Lefschetz-thimble structure for these integrals with contours obtained with\nthe holomorphic flow equations at different flow-times and with numerically\noptimized continuous integration contours, defined by a maximal value of the\nexpectation values of the phases. With the holomorphic flow equation, we\nperform the large flow-time limit, so that the average phase corresponds to its\nvalue on the thimbles. In some of these integrals (the Hubbard-, Gross-Neveu-,\nand Chern-Simons-like integrals), we observe that the convergence to this value\nis not monotonic, meaning that there is an optimal flow-time where the sign\nproblem is weaker than it is on the thimbles.
