The SU(2) manifold structure is handled through a quaternion parameterization. The model is trained on 10,000 configurations generated via Hybrid Monte Carlo at a fixed coupling $β_0= 2.0$ on an $8\\times 8$ lattice, augmented to 20,000 samples via random gauge transformations. Through physics-conditioned sampling exploiting the linear $β$-dependence of the score function, we generate configurations at different values of the coupling without retraining; through the fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions, we generate configurations on lattices of different spatial extents. We validate our approach by comparing the average plaquette and Wilson action density against exact analytical predictions. At the training lattice size ($8\\times 8$), the model reproduces the exact plaquette with biases $|Δ| \\leq 0.001$ for $β\\in [1.5, 2.5]$ and $|Δ| < 0.06$ across $β\\in [1, 4]$. For lattices sharing the training extent $L=8$ in at least one direction, biases remain below $\\sim 0.003$ for $β\\in [1.5, 2.5]$, with larger deviations at higher couplings. This work demonstrates that diffusion models are a promising tool for non-Abelian gauge field generation and motivates further investigation toward higher-dimensional theories."}

To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $μ$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\\langle μ\\rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\\langle μ\\rangle \\neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\\langle μ\\rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods.\n  It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations.\n  As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved."}

We applied this framework to several cavity families composed of smooth, edge-free components, including globally twisted cavities with control-point-defined cross-sections realised in both linear and ring configurations, cavities defined by the intersection of orthogonal prisms, sphere-subtracted cylindrical cavities, and parametrised surface resonators. Two gradient-free optimisation strategies, a genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimisation, were independently employed to explore compact sets of design parameters for these geometries and to optimise a scaled-helicity figure of merit for the dominant helical mode, evaluated via finite-element eigenmode analysis.

While polaritonic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures have been extensively explored in the mid-infrared frequency range, their behaviour at the visible frequencies remains largely unexplored, in part due to the lack of knowledge on natural materials supporting anisotropic and highly confined visible-range polaritons. In this context, MoOCl$_2$, an anisotropic van der Waals metal, is particularly interesting, since it supports hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (PPs) that enable directional propagation and subwavelength light compression. Here, we investigate the strategy for launching anisotropic PPs in MoOCl$_2$ in the visible frequency range using gold rod nanoantennas. The nanoantennas, placed on top of the MoOCl$_2$ crystal, excite in-plane anisotropic PP modes, effectively overcoming the momentum mismatch between waves in free-space and nanoscale PPs. We demonstrate a strong electromagnetic field confinement, angle-dependent absorption, and controlled anisotropic PP launching enabled by gold nanoantennas, highlighting the potential of MoOCl$_2$ as a compact platform for nanoscale waveguiding and optical signal processing. By providing a practical antenna-based strategy for exciting visible-range PPs, this work addresses the lack of compact elements for optical signal manipulation and opens new opportunities for optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals polaritonics."}

Hyperbolic polaritons (HPs) $-$ hybrid light-matter excitations in materials with opposite-signed dielectric permittivity tensor components $-$ offer a solution through their ability to support deep sub-wavelength confinement and unique optical phenomena such as canalization and negative refraction. To date, however, the most widely studied hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) crystals, including hBN and $α$-MoO$_3$, operate mainly in the mid-infrared, leaving the telecommunication bands (1260$-$1675 nm) largely uncovered. Here, we predict HPs operating directly in the telecommunication window in the vdW crystal molybdenum oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Building on recent evidence that MoOCl$_2$ can support plasmon polaritons in the visible, we theoretically investigate its optical response at telecom wavelengths and identify the conditions under which strongly confined, canalized HPs modes emerge. Beyond establishing a telecom platform, we outline device-level opportunities enabled by these modes, including diffraction-free waveguides based on canalization, tunable polaritonic crystals, and high-efficiency spontaneous emission-enhancement platforms. These paradigms cover the essential pillars of on-chip information processing: emission, propagation, modulation and detection. Our results establish MoOCl$_2$ as a potentially transformative material that bridges physics of hyperbolic PPs with potential practical implementations, opening avenues for ultra-compact, high-density, and low-power photonic components."}

Unlike canonical self-accelerating solutions such as Airy beams, general curved-beam propagation enables arbitrary, application-specific trajectories that are not constrained by analytic beam families. Here, we demonstrate a passive and reconfigurable approach for generating trajectory-engineered THz curved beams using inverse-designed bilayer diffractive optical elements (DOEs). Two phase-only diffractive layers are optimized using gradient-based inverse design to produce predetermined curved propagation paths. Reconfiguration is achieved by a 180° rotation of the second layer, which modifies the effective phase profile of the cascaded structure without altering the incident wave or individual layer designs. The proposed system can produce distinct curved trajectories with controlled transverse displacement and beam confinement, as confirmed by scalar diffraction simulations and experimental measurements. Overall, this work establishes inverse-designed cascaded DOEs as a compact and scalable platform for reconfigurable trajectory control of THz beams, providing a flexible alternative to analytic self-accelerating beams for radiative near-field THz communications."}

By employing a 1-MHz non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) with extensive pulse chirping, HELP-CARS increases the coherent Raman excitation efficiency by ~300 times and improves the signal-to-nonresonant background ratio by 11 times, while inducing negligible damage during live cell imaging. Furthermore, to remove non-independent noise and physically entangled non-resonant background, we incorporate self-supervised deep-learning denoising and background removal based on the Kramers-Kronig relationship, yielding sensitivity improvement by an additional order of magnitude. Together, these advances provide a micromolar imaging sensitivity (160 uM for Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6) corresponding to 1000 molecules in the focal volume. Such high sensitivity enables high-fidelity chemical imaging in both fingerprint and silent windows.

Conventional plasmonic approaches typically enhance chirality at the cost of amplifying achiral attraction and heating. Here, we overcome this trade-off by exploiting longitudinal Mie resonances in silicon nanodisks. By employing an Azimuthally-Radially Polarized Beam (ARPB) illumination, we selectively excite longitudinal Mie resonances, with strong optical chirality gradients and comparatively uniform electric field intensities. Specifically, magnetic quadrupole (MQ) resonances, effectively decouple enantioselective forces from the achiral background, providing uniquely favorable conditions for enantioselective optical trapping. Combining full-wave simulations with Kramers' escape-rate theory, we demonstrate a robust trapping system that is both thermally stable and highly selective. We predict trapping selectivity ratios above 100 for particles with Pasteur parameters $|κ| \\geq$ 0.03 and maintain selectivities above 2 even for weakly chiral analytes ($|κ| \\approx$ 0.006).

Here, we propose hyperuniformity and stealthiness in non-Hermitian systems as a generalization of PT-symmetric crystals to correlated disorder. We extend the scattering-microstructure correspondence to open systems, formulating non-Hermitian hyperuniformity and stealthiness that encompass their Hermitian counterparts. This approach, incorporating a statistical crystallography framework for non-Hermitian materials, demonstrates that real-imaginary cross-correlations of the material potential are irrelevant for achieving hyperuniformity but are essential for characterizing stealthiness, revealing unidirectional scattering phases that are inaccessible in Hermitian materials and in non-Hermitian crystals.

We generalize the traditional EIT framework by introducing a spinor representation of bright- and dark-mode resonances, yielding a unified description of design parameters through universal unitary operations. Implementing a coupled-resonator building block that accesses the entire design space through dual-channel gauge fields, we demonstrate a programmable slow-light band in a one-dimensional CRIT lattice.

In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom. However, the interaction mechanisms between multiple transverse orbital angular momentum singularities within a single wave packet remain elusive. This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time.

We predict this response in spin spirals and in specially designed metamaterials, validating the key predictions."}

Their high energy cost in electronic processors motivate scalable photonic computing approaches that reduce the energy required per operation. Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) is a dominant photonic platform due to its large electro-optic effect. However, it lacks nonvolatile index tuning mechanisms, which promise to pave the way for energy-efficient photonic computing. Here, we explore electrochemical lithiation as a route to nonvolatile matrix-vector multiplications in TFLN. The LiNbO3 phase is stable at room temperature over a 2% Li composition window with an associated composition-dependent refractive index. We computationally demonstrate this as a programmable, low-loss approach to perform matrix-vector multiplications by using composition to control matrix weights. We design Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform image processing tasks under realistic material loss constraints. We also design microring resonators for iterative weight updates, using gradient descent training to program target matrix operations with matrix-vector multiplication accuracy validated at 1.5% average relative error. These demonstrations show a facile route towards nonvolatile photonic computing in TFLN, addressing a critical requirement for energy-efficient photonic matrix operations at scale."}
