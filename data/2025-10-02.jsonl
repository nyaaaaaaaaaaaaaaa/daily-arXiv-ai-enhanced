While several models, such as tandem\nneural networks and generative adversarial networks, have been proposed, these\nmethods can be biased and are difficult to scale up to complex structures.\nMoreover, the difficulty in incorporating physical constraints at the inference\ntime hinders the controllability of the model-predicted spectra.
