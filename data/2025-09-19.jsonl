We propose the light-induced\nnonlinear Edelstein effect (NLEE) -- a second-order optical response in which a\nstatic magnetization is induced by a time-dependent electric field -- as a\npromising probe of ferroaxial ordering. First, we elucidate the relationship\nbetween the NLEE tensor and the electric toroidal dipole. By decomposing the\npolarization modes of light, we find that both the linearly polarized and\ncircularly polarized light couple to the electric toroidal dipole via distinct\nmechanisms. We then demonstrate the NLEE using a minimal model that\nincorporates ferroaxial ordering. Our analysis reveals that effective coupling\nbetween orbital magnetization and SOC induces spin magnetization. In\nparticular, the spin magnetization is tilted owing to the electric toroidal\ndipole; the tilt angle reflects the ratio between the ferroaxial-origin SOC and\nthe relativistic SOC."}

However, only a limited number of chiral cavity\nimplementations exhibiting broken time-reversal symmetry have been demonstrated\nto date. These typically rely on either the application of strong magnetic\nfields, circularly polarized Floquet driving, or the hybridization of cavity\nmodes with matter excitations in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Here, we\npresent a one-dimensional terahertz photonic-crystal cavity that exhibits\nbroken time-reversal symmetry. The cavity consists of a high-resistivity\nsilicon wafer sandwiched between lightly n-doped InSb wafers. By exploiting the\nnonreciprocal response of a terahertz magnetoplasma and the exceptionally low\neffective mass of electrons in InSb, we demonstrate a circularly polarized\ncavity mode at 0.67 THz under a modest magnetic field of 0.3 T, with a quality\nfactor exceeding 50. Temperature-, magnetic field-, and polarization-dependent\nmeasurements, supported by simulations, confirm the realization of a chiral\ncavity with broken time-reversal symmetry.

Operating at terahertz oscillation frequencies presents unique\nchallenges based on the method of generation. Electronic oscillators can\nproduce ample power but suffer from relatively high phase noise due to the\nnonlinear multiplication of microwave sources. Meanwhile, photomixing of\noptical sources provides superior spectral purity but low usable power, due to\nthe limited bandwidth of the photomixer. We propose a hybrid solution involving\ninjection locking of an electronic oscillator, a resonant tunneling diode, by a\nlow phase noise photomixed source, a dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept injection-locking amplifier at 260\nGHz, achieving up to 40 dB gain for nanowatt-level input signals. For the first\ntime, we characterize the residual phase noise of an injection-locked waveguide\nRTD, showing quantitative consistency with theoretical predictions based on\ndetailed analysis of its free-running noise.

Experimentally,\nsuch control can be achieved by pulsed modifications of the optical potential\nconfining the nanoparticle. Most frequently, the applied potential pulses are\nparabolic in nanoparticle position, and they expand/squeeze or displace the\ninitial Gaussian state of motion to a modified Gaussian state. The\ntime-dependent mean values and covariance matrix of the phase-space variables\ncan fully characterize such a state. However, quasi-parabolic optical\npotentials with added weak Duffing-type nonlinearity, encountered in real-world\nexperiments, can generally distort the state of motion to a non-Gaussian one,\nfor which the description based solely on the mean values and covariance matrix\nfails. Here, we introduce a nonlinear transformation of the phase-space\ncoordinates using the concept of Fermat's spiral, which effectively removes the\nstate distortion induced by the Duffing-type nonlinearity and enables\ncharacterization of the state of motion by the standard Gaussian-state metrics.\nComparisons of the experimental data with theoretical models show that the\nproposed coordinate transformation can recover the ideal behavior of a harmonic\noscillator even after extended evolution of the system in the nonlinear\npotential. The presented scheme enables the separation of the effects of the\napplied state manipulation, the system's gradual thermalization, and the\nnonlinearity of the confinement on the experimentally observed dynamics of the\nsystem, thereby facilitating the design of advanced protocols for levitated\noptomechanics."}
