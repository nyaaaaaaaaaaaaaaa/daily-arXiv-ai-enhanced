The sea sector is based on gauge\nensembles with $N_{\\rm f}=2+1$ flavours of non-perturbatively O($a$)-improved\nWilson fermions generated by the Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS)\ninitiative. The parameter space of the considered ensembles encompasses five\nvalues of the lattice spacing, a range of pion masses extending down to the\nphysical point, and large physical volumes. In the valence sector, we employ\nWilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist, using the same massless\nWilson-Dirac operator in both the sea and valence sectors. We describe the\nstrategy applied for the required matching of the sea and valence quark masses\nalong the target renormalised chiral trajectory. A precise universality test is\nthen conducted by comparing the continuum-limit results of the mixed-action\napproach and of the unitary setup, in which the same Wilson fermion\nregularisation is employed in the sea and in the valence. As a key application,\nwe conduct a scale setting procedure based on lattice determinations of the\nmasses and decay constants of the pion and kaon, as well as the gradient flow\nscale $t_0$. The scale setting can consequently be performed in three distinct\nways, utilising the unitary setup, the mixed action approach, and their\ncombination.

This equivalence is not approximate or analogical\nbut mathematically identical to first order in $U/v$, sharing the same form\ndiscovered by Fresnel in 1818 for light in moving transparent media. We\ndemonstrate that all three systems-bubble acoustics, optical drag, and\nrelativistic velocity addition-are described by a universal partial entrainment\nequation where wave coupling to compliant components determines the drag\ncoefficient. In bubbly liquids this physics is directly observable: waves\ncouple to compressible bubbles rather than rigid liquid. Since bubble dynamics\nreproduces the relativistic result, velocity addition itself admits mechanical\ninterpretation. Von Laue's 1907 derivation abstracted mechanics into\nkinematics; we reverse this, showing relativistic effects preserve mechanical\ncontent in abstract form. Beyond first-order equivalence, we show Fresnel's\ndispersive term encodes group velocity (energy transport) versus phase velocity\n(wave-crest motion)-a distinction mechanical models naturally capture but pure\nkinematic velocity addition cannot address. The rigidity-based interpretation\nof dispersion, established in acoustic metamaterials, provides cross-domain\ninsights for materials design and suggests testable predictions linking\nacoustic compliance to optical drag. This three-way equivalence reduces\nindependent phenomena to a single principle: waves riding compliant inclusions.\nFresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization all emerge as\naspects of this one mechanism, traced through the historical\ndensity-versus-rigidity fork that shaped aether theory's trajectory.

Achieving machine learning recognition of fractional-order\nvortex beams under diffraction conditions is currently an urgent and unreported\nissue. Based on ResNet, a deep learning (DL) method of accurately recognizing\nthe propagation distance and topological charge of fractional-order vortex beam\ndiffraction process is proposed in this work.
