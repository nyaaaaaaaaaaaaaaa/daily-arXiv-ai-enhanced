It is usually parameterized in terms of structure functions, which encode all necessary information for all kinematic regions. Moreover, the structure functions can be factorized in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and contains information on hadron resonances. On the lattice, we can calculate the corresponding matrix element of two quark-bilinear currents with a relative Euclidean time separation. The reconstruction of the hadronic tensor in Minkowski space requires appropriate dealing with the corresponding inverse problem. In our current work, we extend previous calculations on the nucleon by considering a much larger range of momentum transfers, which is inevitable in the context of structure functions. This can be achieved by using stochastic sources, which allows us to calculate the required four-point functions in a broad kinematic region.

We theoretically analyze the underlying $2^{nd}$ plateau physical mechanism and determine that: (i) It differs from the standard SFA-like mechanism; (ii) It is recombination- based; (iii) It has an unusual inverted cutoff scaling with wavelength (whereby the cutoff decreases with increasing wavelength, until reaching a saturation); and (iv) It exhibits a linear cutoff dependence with electric field amplitude E$_0$ .

Most on-chip squeezed-light sources rely on Kerr ($χ^{(3)}$) nonlinearities, remain limited by pump power and excess loss constraints. Quadratic ($χ^{(2)}$) platforms instead provide stronger parametric interactions, lower pump power requirements, and greater spectral engineering flexibility. Here, we demonstrate strong, broadband squeezed-light generation on a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip using a dual-resonant optical parametric amplifier implemented in a single periodically poled LN (PPLN) microresonator. Near-full-depth domain inversion is achieved simultaneously with highly over-coupled resonances, exhibiting escape efficiencies exceeding 90% and intrinsic quality factors above 2.5 million in a 0.6 mm$^2$ X-cut TF-PPLN resonator, enabling efficient squeezing at 1587 nm when pumped at 793.5 nm. Operating in the continuous-wave regime, we directly measure -0.81 dB of squeezing below the shot-noise limit with a pump power of 27 mW, together with +4.29 dB of anti-squeezing. From these measurements, we infer an on-chip squeezing level of -7.52 dB $\\pm$ 0.22 dB (95% confidence interval: [-7.96,-7.10] dB), and an on-chip anti-squeezing level of +9.62 dB $\\pm$ 0.25 dB.

A flexible setup combining spectral and phase shaping of both pump and local oscillator fields with frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection is employed to examine how intracavity dispersion influences squeezing. Different cavity configurations with varying finesse and dispersion conditions are studied, and the squeezing is measured as a function of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth. Contrary to expectations based on existing theoretical models, the measured squeezing levels remain essentially unchanged as dispersion varies. To account for these observations, a modeling approach is introduced in which intracavity dispersion is described as an effective spectral filtering occurring at the stage of SPOPO supermode generation. Within this framework, the filtering is incorporated directly into the interaction Hamiltonian of the nonlinear process. This perspective establishes a consistent experimental benchmark for the study of dispersion in SPOPOs and underscores the importance of spectral filtering in the interpretation of multimode squeezing experiments."}

The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks."}

Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure.

Talk presented at the 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (LATTICE2025), 2-8 November 2025, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India", "summary": "In recent years, lattice QCD calculations of hadron spectroscopy have concentrated on resonances and shallow bound states detected via poles in two- and three-hadron scattering amplitudes. Hadron interactions have therefore become a key focus. In these proceedings, I review the current state of the art and recent advances in methods for studying hadron interactions via finite-volume spectroscopy and finite-volume quantization conditions. I will also review recent spectroscopy studies and results presented at Lattice 2025, with a focus on charmed mesons, the doubly charmed tetraquark, and the doubly bottom tetraquark."}

Bank"], "title": "Enhanced Interband Optical Nonlinearities from Coupled Quantum Wells", "comment": null, "summary": "The recent, rapid advances in nonlinear chipscale nanophotonics in the visible and near-infrared have been largely driven by manipulating the local dielectric environment proximate to decades-old workhorse bulk nonlinear optical materials, rather than increasing the inherent strength of their nonlinear response. While proposed decades ago, we demonstrate the first experimental realization of a new class of designer nonlinear materials that leverage the interband optical transition in asymmetric structures to provide strong second order susceptibility, $χ^{(2)}$. Using simple AlGaAs/GaAs coupled quantum wells operating in the near-infrared as a prototype, we observed strong second harmonic generation enhancement of 1550 nm to 775 nm over bulk controls. Extracted $χ^{(2)}$ values were as high as 2750 pm/V, which is $>$7x that of bulk GaAs. Furthermore, measured susceptibilities agreed well with quantum mechanical calculations of $χ^{(2)}$ using layer profiles extracted from electron microscopy. Growth interruptions were employed to improve interfacial abruptness in response to electron microscopy characterization, resulting in increased $χ^{(2)}$ toward the simulation predictions for ideal heterointerfaces. More complex layer designs showed predicted $χ^{(2)}$ up to 7 nm/V. Such materials are anticipated to find myriad applications, including entangled photon generation at telecommunications wavelengths for chipscale quantum information processing."}

Estakhri"], "title": "Coherent Virtual Absorption in Dielectric Metasurfaces", "comment": null, "summary": "Through temporal shaping of the excitation signal, the complex-frequency scattering zeros of a lossless structure can be accessed, enabling a storage-release mechanism referred to as coherent virtual absorption. Practical demonstrations of this mechanism, however, have been limited to simple configurations such as slabs and spheres, where analytical solutions allow accurate prediction of the complex-frequency scattering zeros. Here, we extend this concept into the realm of metasurfaces and demonstrate coherent virtual absorption in realistic and dispersive metasurface configurations. Through a combination of full-wave analysis and rational approximation, we present a practical scheme to identify suitable complex-frequency zeros and achieve coherent virtual absorption successfully. Our approach can be implemented in arbitrary metasurface configurations with any number of ports, providing a robust framework for optimized energy storage, memories, optical sensing, and modulation in practical photonic systems."}

Drawing from these concepts, it is shown that temporal metamaterials with simultaneous passive permittivity and permeability switching exhibit wideband absorption with impedance-matching, effectively behaving as one-dimensional perfectly matched layers. Under the effective medium theory, the loss mechanism is attributed to the emergent effective electric and magnetic conductivities, which are used to derive an approximate matching condition for asynchronous modulation and to engineer lossy material properties. The proposed approach and its performance beyond the Rozanov bound are verified with semi-analytical calculations as well as full-wave simulations, and the possibility of realizing a two-dimensional temporal perfectly matched layer is discussed."}
