Recently, multiple predictions for hadron structure functions have been derived and compared with experimental measurements and lattice QCD calculations, finding a general agreement. In order to explore the precision of the instanton liquid model, one has to compare its predictions with non-perturbative simulations in a regime dominated by instanton dynamics. This has been performed for two gluon-sensitive observables: the gluon Green's function and the strong running coupling constant. In this contribution, we propose to study a fermionic observable, the pion electromagnetic form factor, for which instanton liquid model predictions have been discussed in Phys.Rev.D 109, 074029. We use the Wilson flow to single out the dominant contribution from the instantons out of a lattice QCD configuration ensemble. We describe the details of our numerical setup, and some first, preliminary results."}

Instead of enlarging the physical aperture, they rely on strongly coupled currents, near-field energy storage, and controlled modal interference so that a compact structure radiates with enhanced directivity. This review emphasizes link-relevant evaluation and reporting: realized gain referenced to a stated impedance plane, clearly stated bandwidth definitions (impedance and performance), and robustness to fabrication spread and platform/environmental loading. Two practical implementation routes are surveyed. The first uses resonant, tightly coupled arrays, including fully driven arrays and single-chain designs based on parasitic or reactively loaded elements. The second uses single-body radiators that enforce a targeted mixture of multipoles or resonant/characteristic modes with one or a few feeds, including symmetry-broken dielectric resonators and mixed electric--magnetic designs. Across RF, microwave, and optical regimes, the same penalties recur as superdirectivity is pushed: reduced radiation resistance, rapid impedance variation, narrow usable bandwidth, and strong sensitivity to small perturbations. Beyond geometric synthesis and multi-resonant stacking, the review highlights emerging levers that can shift these trade-offs in specific system contexts: low-loss materials and cryogenic operation to improve efficiency and frequency stability, and time-varying loading and matching (Floquet/parametric approaches) that can relax linear time-invariant bandwidth constraints, at the cost of added control complexity and spectral conversion."}

Yet standard impedance/scattering tools and weak-loss resonator approximations do not provide low-dimensional invariants that remain predictive under intrinsic asymmetry and realistic boundaries, nor do they cleanly separate total absorption from useful power delivered to a load. Here we develop a unified mass--energy framework for linear, single-mode, one-dimensional systems, in which energy-like and power-flow variables $(\\mathcal{U},\\mathcal{S})$ satisfy the universal invariant $\\mathcal{U}^2-\\mathcal{S}^2=|Γ_g|^2$, with the effective standing-wave ``mass'' $|Γ_g|$ becoming state-dependent under asymmetry. The Cai--Smith chart gives a bounded state-space map of stability, feedback proximity and operating states, and makes explicit the divergence between maximum absorption and useful delivery under loss. We derive four laws governing absorption and emission, validate the invariant in multiport optics via coherent perfect absorption at exceptional points using a basis-independent SVD criterion (reconciling quadratic vs quartic near-zero scaling), and map electrochemical polarization onto the same geometry by extracting $|Γ_g|$ from two-mode orthogonal fits to reveal a universal storage-to-transfer transition across pH. This framework provides a transferable design language for dissipative, boundary-controlled systems."}

However, a significant challenge remains in generating and distributing coherent light from a single on-chip source with high phase stability across multiple channels. Integrated lasers typically operate independently, and conventional splitters (e.g., multi-mode interferometers) do not guarantee the phase coherence required for advanced applications. Here, we report a purely geometric scheme for achieving massive equipartition of coherent light on a photonic chip by leveraging the geometric phases of a null space spanned by degenerate states with zero eigenvalue. The evolution of the null space maps to real-space rotation described by the special orthogonal group SO(N), thus enabling precise and scalable control over light distribution by engineering the system parameters. We experimentally realize up to one-to-nine equipartition of light on a waveguide array fabricated on a glass-based photonic chip. The framework can be upscaled for one-to-N light distribution. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for integrated coherent light sources, paving the way for integrated photonic applications such as quantum photonics and optical computing."}

The optical superlattice, with odd or even number of unit cells, can exhibit either a trivial or a non-trivial underlying topology, characterized by the corresponding Zak phase. We focus on a distinct localization mechanism in the intermediate harmonic trapping frequency regime. Specifically, the four lowest-lying eigenstates in this regime form an effective four-level system in the topologically non-trivial configuration. Larger trapping frequency values drive the system into a harmonic trap dominated regime, featuring classical pairing and localization of all states of the lower band, as in a usual optical lattice. For the lower trapping frequency regime, the fate of topological edge states is discussed. Our results are based on exact diagonalization and on a tight-binding approximation that maps the continuous to a discrete system. We address several aspects relevant to the experimental implementation of optical superlattices and provide a brief illustration of the dynamics, highlighting direct ways to observe and distinguish between the different localization mechanisms."}

However, its implementation is hindered by real-world distortions, for example, atmospheric turbulence in free-space, with severe and rapidly evolving phase perturbations that alter the amplitude, phase and vectorial polarization structure of the beam. Here, we demonstrate that optical topologies in the form of skyrmions are highly resilient to the effects of real-world atmospheric turbulence. We create and transmit these particle-like topologies of light through a 270~m free-space optical link, revealing their robustness across a wide variety of conditions and turbulence strengths. While we observe severe distortion in the states' underlying degrees of freedom, we show that the topological numbers are preserved in all cases. We account for fast changes to the medium, where the channel produces statistically averaged outcomes, by probing the state's decoherence, showing that while the degree of polarisation consequently decays, the topology remains intact. Using topology, we show information can be transmitted through the channel with almost perfect fidelity (>98%) in most cases, only decreasing to 86% in the most severe conditions tested. Our work is the first to demonstrate the potential for optical topologies as reliable and robust information carriers in a real-world environment and points to the potential for other complex channels too, offering attractive features for classical and quantum communication alike."}

However, conventional cryogenic MIR cameras face a fundamental trade-off between frame rate, noise, and pixel format. Here we report a passive, incoherent MIR imaging platform that leverages sum-frequency upconversion in chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPLN) to translate broadband 3--5um scenes to the near-infrared, enabling ultrafast acquisition on a silicon-based intensified CCD (iCCD). In fast-kinetics mode we achieve a physical frame rate of 100kHz with microsecond-scale gate control, and we directly capture the full evolution of an air-breakdown electric arc, resolving its rapid ignition, expansion, and decay dynamics. Beyond demonstrating ultrafast passive imaging, we introduce a drift-aware calibration workflow based on Allan deviation analysis to quantitatively select the gate width and averaging strategy under realistic slow-drift and multiplicative noise. This combined capability -- ultrafast passive MIR imaging plus operationally meaningful calibration -- provides a practical route toward real-time thermal surveillance and early-warning systems for hazardous fast transients."}

Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission.

Two DHM prototypes were developed; an initial lens-based system serving as the foundation for algorithm development, and experimental validation of the approach, achieving 89.6% classification accuracy on a 3-part differential, and a subsequent lensless system for simplified design and increased field-of-view (FoV). Both prototypes employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cell classification. With further optimizations, the lensless system achieved classification accuracies of 92.65% and 89.44% on the 3-part and 5-part differential, respectively. With the lensless system, the derivation of the monocyte distribution width (MDW), a biomarker for sepsis, was also demonstrated.\n  Additionally, pixel super-resolution and multi-wavelength DHM approaches were investigated to enhance the obtained cell information.

However, several ultra stable laser systems observed additional noise sources that hinder the realization of the expected improvements in frequency stability. These additional noise sources are related to the birefringence of the coatings and its modification by intracavity light. The origin of the birefringence is not yet well understood and its modification via illumination remains unexplained. Here we present an extensive study on the steady-state and transient modification of the birefringence by intracavity light and by uniform illumination at various wavelengths using an optical cavity at room temperature. We find a unified description that suggests a primary two-photon process for photon energies below the bandgap of GaAs, or a single-photon process at higher energies. Adding external illumination allows to reduce noise induced by laser power fluctuations by balancing the photo-thermal-optic response of the mirrors and the photo-birefringent effect at a more favorable low intracavity power."}

Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information. Our ConvRML system benefits from both the optical and the computational developments presented in this work, and our contributions establish resources to support continued development of high-quality, compact, and compressive lensless imagers."}
