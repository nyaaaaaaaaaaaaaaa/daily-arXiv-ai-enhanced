The structure functions as a nanoscale undulator (NU): the electrons moving through the nanogap are driven by a spatially periodic, transverse optical near-field. We show that the transverse near-field can actively shape the electron wavefunction by inducing both a periodic oscillation and a quantum squeezing of its width. We then validate this theoretical framework by numerically solving the relativistically corrected time-dependent Schrödinger equation (RC-TDSE). The generated femtosecond pulse trains can be spectrally, temporally, and spatially controlled. This framework establishes the transverse optical near-field interaction as a novel mechanism to spatiotemporally shape electron wavefunctions, which illuminates a path to versatile platform for on-chip femtosecond coherent light source and the application in free-electron quantum optics."}

However, achieving uniform PeNPLs and effective surface passivation major challenges, especially for red-emitting iodide-based compounds. Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission. When integrated into light-emitting diodes, our PeNPL devices achieve a external quantum efficiency of 13.1%, the highest reported for strongly-confined PeNPL-based devices. Taken together, these results establish ancillary ligand-induced synthesis of uniform-monolayer PeNPLs as a decisive route to robust orientation control, positioning it as the central principle for advancing next-generation photonic and display technologies."}

These properties, together with low-cost and scalable solution-phase fabrication, position PNCs as attractive alternatives to traditional epitaxial and colloidal quantum dots. In this Review, we outline the physical parameters that define quantum emission in PNCs, compare their performance to other established and emerging quantum emitters, and assess the key figures of merit, including photostability, single-photon purity, and photon indistinguishability, required for practical quantum applications. We discuss underlying mechanisms affecting PNC emission behavior and highlight recent advances in improving their quantum emitting properties through synthetic and photonic engineering approaches. While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources."}

This paper presents a deep learning-enhanced framework for delineating anticoagulant efficacy ex vivo using Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM). We demonstrate a label-free, non-invasive approach for analyzing human blood samples, capable of accurate cell counting and morphological estimation. A DHM with an automated image processing and deep learning pipeline is built for morphological analysis of the blood cells under two different anti-coagulation agents, e.g. conventional EDTA and novel potassium ferric oxalate nanoparticles (KFeOx-NPs). This enables automated high-throughput screening of cells and estimation of blood coagulation rates when samples are treated with different anticoagulants. Results indicated that KFeOx-NPs prevented human blood coagulation without altering the cellular morphology of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas EDTA incubation caused notable changes within 6 hours of incubation. The system allows for quantitative analysis of coagulation dynamics by assessing parameters like cell clustering and morphology over time in these prepared samples, offering insights into the comparative efficacy and effects of anticoagulants outside the body."}

We present the experimental implementation of three-dimensional (3D) Stokes polarimetric imaging of nonparaxial optical fields with nanoscale spatial resolution. This approach extends classical Stokes polarimetry (traditionally limited to paraxial fields) into the nonparaxial regime. We use an array of gold nanospheres, each acting as a localized electric dipolar scatterer, to probe 3D polarization states over a field of view of tens of micrometers. The scattered signal is collected by a high numerical aperture objective lens and separated into its circular polarization components, providing a very simple imaging system. We introduce a computational algorithm to efficiently extract the physical parameters from the generated dipole spread functions with a high throughput across the whole field of view. Finally, we show that this method can also be applied to single-molecule localization and orientation fluorescence microscopy."}

However, conventional implementations require polarization-diverse detection and are therefore incompatible with most commercial OCT systems. As a result, PS-OCT has largely remained restricted to specialized research groups, limiting its broader scientific and clinical use. Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments."}

We investigate how to inversely design plasmonic nanostructures using conditional generative adversarial networks. Although a conventional approach of measuring the optical properties of a given nanostructure is conceptually straightforward, inverse design remains difficult because the existence and uniqueness of an acceptable design cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the design space is often large, and simulation-based methods become quickly intractable. Deep learning methods are well-suited to tackle this problem because they can handle effectively high-dimensional input data. We train a conditional generative adversarial network model and use it for inverse design of plasmonic nanostructures based on their extinction cross section spectra. Our main result shows that adding label projection and a novel embedding network to the conditional generative adversarial network model, improves performance in terms of error estimates and convergence speed for the training algorithm. The mean absolute error is reduced by an order of magnitude in the best case, and the training algorithm converges more than three times faster on average. This is shown for two network architectures, a simpler one using a fully connected neural network architecture, and a more complex one using convolutional layers. We pre-train a convolutional neural network and use it as surrogate model to evaluate the performance of our inverse design model. The surrogate model evaluates the extinction cross sections of the design predictions, and we show that our modifications lead to equally good or better predictions of the original design compared to a baseline model. This provides an important step towards more efficient and precise inverse design methods for optical elements."}

Adams", "Daniel Heligman", "Rajind Mendis", "Josh Wetherington"], "title": "Arbitrary geometry electromagnetic spatiotemporal vortices from phase velocity shearing", "comment": null, "summary": "In fluids, vortices form at boundaries between flows of different velocities. Here, we show that pulsed electromagnetic waves form spatiotemporal vortices when light straddles media of different phase velocities. When the resulting relative time-delay is on the order of the pulse duration of light, spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) are formed. This method allows generating arbitrary geometry spatiotemporal vortices, something impossible with previously demonstrated generation schemes. We provide experimental results showing THz frequency light can be encoded with arbitrary spatiotemporal vortex geometries using simple planar fused filament prints made from a commercial 3D printer. We provide several demonstrations of unique geometries including squares, triangles, ring arrays, and arbitrary curves that cannot be generated with existing techniques. We also show that multiple ring and line vortices can be formed simultaneously, which undergo complex reconnections with propagation. While demonstrated at THz frequencies, this concept is directly applicable to visible and infrared light and our theory offers a way for optimizing STOVs for the frequency range and pulse duration of a given light source. This technique provides a practical and straight-forward method to generate arbitrary electromagnetic spatiotemporal vortices and enables production of complex spatiotemporal phenomena like vortex reconnections."}

Deop-Ruano", "Diego M. Solís", "Alejandro Manjavacas"], "title": "Lattice Resonances in Periodic Arrays of Time-Modulated Scatterers", "comment": "41 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Lattice resonances are collective optical modes supported by periodic arrays of scatterers, arising from their coherent interaction enabled by the underlying periodicity. Owing to their collective nature, these resonances produce optical responses that are both stronger and spectrally narrower than those of individual scatterers. While such phenomena have been extensively studied in conventional time-invariant systems, recent advances in time-varying photonics present new opportunities to exploit and enhance the extraordinary characteristics of these collective modes. Here, we investigate lattice resonances in periodic arrays of time-modulated scatterers using a simple framework based on the dipolar approximation and time-Floquet theory, where each scatterer is modeled as a harmonic oscillator with periodically varying optical properties. We begin by analyzing the response of an individual scatterer, leveraging our model to identify the complex eigenfrequencies that define its dynamics. We show that, for the appropriate modulation amplitude and frequency, the imaginary part of one of these eigenfrequencies vanishes, leading to amplification. Building on this, we extend our analysis to a periodic array to investigate the effect of the interplay between temporal modulation and lattice resonances. In contrast to isolated scatterers, the collective nature of lattice resonances introduces a markedly more intricate spectral dependence of the amplification regime. Notably, this amplification emerges at substantially lower modulation strengths, facilitated by the enhanced light-matter interaction and increased lifetime provided by these collective resonances. Our work establishes a simple theoretical framework for understanding collective lattice resonances in time-modulated arrays, enabling dynamic control and amplification of these modes."}

We highlight mechanisms for deterministic pulse shaping, including four-wave-mixing-based spectral-phase transfer in HCCs, and show how tailored STC waveforms steer emission dynamics from the multiphoton to tunneling regimes, enabling sub-cycle gating, momentum control, and brightness scaling. We conclude with open challenges: phase stability, mid-IR scalability, coupling to nanophotonic emitters, metrology of vectorial fields, and outline a path toward compact, ultrafast, phase-coherent electron sources and emerging quantum applications powered by nonlinear photonics."}
