Using the expansion in Gegenbauer polynomials, we provide analytic expressions for several three-point correlation functions in theories with one massive and one massless field. To this end, a class of antiderivatives of products of two Bessel functions multiplied by a power of their common argument are studied systematically. We expect these results to be useful in perturbative calculations involving vertices of high degree, at finite temperature and/or in finite volume, as well as in auxiliary perturbative computations for a lattice QCD treatment of hadronic effects in precision observables. As an illustration, we compute the one-loop coordinate-space propagator of a massive particle coupled to a massless one, both in the vacuum and at finite temperature."}

The resulting fault-tolerant T gate costs for a fiducial calculation of shear viscosity would require about $10^{12}$ T gates which compares favorably to other modern estimates."}

Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band (λ~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of λ~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns. This work provides a crucial platform for future research on integrated microcavity enhancement techniques and coupled QDs with other quantum photonics in the telecom bands, offering significant prospects for quantum network applications."}

Here, we report on the realization of an optical sensor where non-reciprocal light propagation allows detecting small perturbations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that scales exponentially with system size. Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain. Our results open a new paradigm in non-Hermitian sensing, with potential applications in remote sensing including the optical readout of superconducting circuits."}

By replacing the 2D raster scan with a simple 1D axial scan, our approach reduces the number of required diffraction patterns by approximately an order of magnitude while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. We have experimentally validated this concept, successfully performing simultaneous spectroscopic imaging of a sample and quantitative wavefront characterization of the illumination, thereby accurately quantifying the chromatic aberration of a broadband field. This capability establishes AP-CDI as a highly efficient and versatile tool for real-time, multi-modal imaging, with immediate potential in ultrafast science, material characterization, and live-cell bio-imaging."}

Through explicit application of the optical metric formulation of TO, we demonstrate that any smooth, passive, impedance-matched transformation performs as a canonical (symplectic) mapping on optical phase space. In combination with Hamiltonian ray dynamics, this indicates that Liouville theorem is as well applicable to TO media: the phase-space volume element is preserved, radiance remains constant along rays, and etendue won't decrease under any passive TO mapping. Based on this novel notion, which has never been mentioned in TO literature before, we develop a radiance-invariant phase-space measure specific to TO media. We then utilize it to find severe analytical limitations on field enhancement. We demonstrate that the maximum attainable average intensity in any passive TO concentrator is exclusively constrained by the area-compression ratio of the coordinate mapping, irrespective of material implementation. Using the same paradigm on zero-index media, optical-null media, and illusion devices reveals the same rules. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that transformation optics (TO) can redistribute intensity but cannot increase radiance, and they give a Liouville-type theorem within this field. This provides a consistent, metric-based elucidation for the intrinsic limitations of concentration in passive metamaterials and extreme-index platforms."}

We derived equations connecting the parameters of the circular orbits centered on the beams axis to the optical force and torque. The equations show that, besides orbital rotation, the spheroidal particle simultaneously rotates around its equatorial axis. We found that two distinct dynamic regimes are possible. The orbital motion can be accompanied by a rapid proper rotation with angular velocity an order of magnitude larger than the angular velocity of the orbital rotation. Alternatively, the orbital and proper rotations can be synchronized. The direction of orbital rotation can either coincide with or be opposite to the direction of rotation of the electric vector. The findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations. The results can be of use in development of nano-scale gyroscopes as well in shape-selective sorting of submicron particles."}

In a projective picture, the evolution of each mode appears as a Möbius isometry on the Poincaré disk, where topologies of trajectories distinguish stable, unstable, and critical regimes. The geometric phase is related to the hyperbolic area enclosed by cyclic paths in the complex projective Hilbert space. This framework offers an intuitive view of stability and topology in quantum photonic time crystals."}

Including on-chip and fiber-to-chip losses we obtain a conversion efficiency of 152 %/W, thus demonstrating a promising approach for future scalable integrated devices."}

When processes occur on sub-picosecond timescales, time-resolved methods such as transient absorption, up-conversion, and optical Kerr gating (OKG) can be utilized to probe these dynamics, though they are typically applied to ensembles rather than single emitters. The OKG technique offers high detection efficiency over a broad spectral range, making it particularly promising for ultrafast single-photon detection at high-repetition-rates. Here, we present an ultrafast scheme based on the third-order nonlinearity of bismuth borosilicate (BBS) glass, operating at a 1 GHz repetition rate with less than 1 nJ pulse energy under focusing, and achieving a time resolution down to 175 fs. BBS glass was selected for its high nonlinear coefficient, which enhances detection efficiency, sub-ps response time, and its compatibility with standard microscopy platforms."}
