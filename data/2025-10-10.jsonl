In\nfew-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak\ninterlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to\nreach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic\ncrystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong\ninterlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling\nenables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist\nangles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using\na two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band\ncascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings.
