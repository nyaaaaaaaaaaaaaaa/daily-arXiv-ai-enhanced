Traditional compactifications at finite temperature\nwithout rotations typically involve ${\\mathbb T}^4$ as the space-time manifold\nwithin a path integral formulation and also moving frames can be accommodated\nby shifted boundary conditions on the same space. We show that consistent\ndescriptions of a rotating box are possible on space-time manifolds with\ntopology different from ${\\mathbb T}^4$ but still flat and without boundary and\nwe classify all possible geometries. The non-trivial topology may be\nimplemented by rotated boundary conditions allowing for a path integral\nformulation. The purely imaginary angular velocity in temperature units cannot\nbe arbitrary but several discrete values are possible. We also discuss finite\nvolume effects in detail."}

Here, we proposed an ingenious\npolarization-independent truncated pyramid-shaped symmetric multilayer\nmetamaterial absorber in a metal-insulator-metal-insulator (MIMI) architecture\nwith almost complete absorption over a broad wavelength range. A total of six\nstructures (W/AlN, Mo/AlN, Ta/AlN, Rh/MgO, Rh/SiO2, Re/BN) were designed, and\nthe materials were selected based on their lattice matching to prevent\ndelamination at interfaces between layers. The absorption mechanism was studied\nat room temperature using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and\nthe structure was optimized through a brute force design approach, which\nillustrates a best average absorption of 98.2% till 4000 nm and 97.73% till\n5072 nm wavelength for the W/AlN structure with metal and dielectric\nthicknesses of 60 nm and 17.5 nm, respectively. Moreover, W/AlN structure\nexhibits over 96% average absorption up to 50 degree incident angles\nirrespective of polarizations. The thermal stability was evaluated using the\nfinite element method (FEM) by determining von Mises stress at elevated\ntemperatures. Thermal analysis revealed that only W/AlN can withstand around\n1700 K temperature and 1500 times the incident power before permanent\ndeformation. A temperature-dependent Drude-Lorentz model was used to further\nanalyze the effect of absorption on the optical performance of the highly\nabsorptive and thermally stable W/AlN structure. Additionally, we determined\nthe effect of the concentration factor, and the operating temperature on the\nsystem efficiency by considering the emission loss of the heated absorber."}

Leveraging the polarization invariance of conventional\noptical needles, we realize the Stokes skyrmion needle using a single plasmonic\nmetalens,designed to function as both a polarization filter and a\nsuper-resolving focusing element.Experimental and simulation results verify\nnon-diffractive propagation over an extended depth of focus (up to 5 lambda),\nwhile the Stokes-vector texture retained at subdiffraction scales throughout\npropagation.

Although employing\nlarger poling periods can ease fabrication, it inevitably reduces conversion\nefficiency, a drawback that can be compensated by using a cavity. In this work,\nwe employed a semi-monolithic cavity to enhance the efficiency of 7th-order\nsymmetric SHG, achieving a measured one-sided conversion efficiency of 7.2 %,\nwhich corresponds to a theoretical total efficiency of 14.4 %.

In general, chirality manifests itself in\noptical activity (circular dichroism or circular birefringence). Chiral\nplasmonic nanoparticles have been recently developed for molecular enantiomer\nseparation, chiral sensing and chiral photocatalysis. Here, we show that\noptical chirality of plasmonic nanoparticles exhibiting strong scattering can\nremain completely undetected using standard characterisation techniques, such\nas circular dichroism measurements. This phenomenon, which we term meso-chiral\nin analogy to meso-compounds in chemistry, is based on mutual cancellation of\nabsorption and scattering chiral responses. As a prominent example, the\nmeso-optical behaviour has been numerically demonstrated in multi-wound-SiO2/Au\nnanoparticles over the entire visible spectral range and in other prototypical\nchiral nanoparticles in narrower spectral ranges. The meso-chiral property has\nbeen experimentally verified by demonstrating chiral absorption of gold\nhelicoid nanoparticles at the wavelength where conventional circular dichroism\nmeasurements show absence of chiral response (gext=0). These findings\ndemonstrate a valuable link between microscopic to macroscopic manifestations\nof chirality and can provide insights for interpreting a wide range of\nexperimental results and designing chiral properties of plasmonic\nnanoparticles."}

In ideal linear devices, however, this\nresponsivity gain is reconciled by a matching divergence in the quantum\nshot-noise floor, so the net signal-to-noise ratio remains unchanged. Recent\nwork has extended this argument to nonlinear devices, such as above-threshold\nlasers, predicting other divergences at an EP that is shifted by the interplay\nof noise and saturation effects. Here we analyze a system of two coupled\nsaturable resonators and show analytically that a self-consistent treatment of\nfluctuation dynamics removes these divergences entirely. Islands of instability\narise in the parameter space surrounding the EP due to the coupling of phase\nnoise into the amplitude dynamics, dictating a maximum responsivity and maximum\nnoise that can be experimentally observed. Stochastic Langevin simulations of\nthe full nonlinear system corroborate our analytical results down to zero\ndetuning."}
