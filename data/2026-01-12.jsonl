We introduce plasmon-enabled DBRs (PE DBRs) based on modulation-doped monolithic InP, where plasmonic dispersion in highly doped layers provides a strong refractive-index contrast. Using inverse-design optimization targeting reduced free-carrier absorption and maximized reflectivity, we demonstrate that PE DBRs can achieve reflectivities approaching 100%. Experimentally grown 14 μm thick InP PE DBRs exhibit up to 99% reflectance with bandwidths reaching 18% of the design wavelength. The monolithic, junction-free configuration ensures low resistivity and enhanced thermal performance, offering a scalable platform for efficient plasmonic mirrors in MIR photonics, with potential applications in photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and lasers."}

Vitullo", "Avik Dutt"], "title": "Multiband Topological Heterojunctions on the Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics Platform", "comment": "24 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Analogue Hamiltonian simulation (AHS) in photonic systems can be an enticing alternative to direct experimental study of complex Hamiltonian systems as a result of the low cost and high degree of control one can have over the system's properties. Notably, the field of topological photonics has emerged in the last decade primarily by simulating tight-binding models of electrons within topologically nontrivial condensed-matter systems. Optical simulation of topologically nontrivial Hamiltonians requires optical resonators with minimal loss and well-matched frequencies whose intersite coupling can also be precisely controlled. The Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) platform satisfies all these requirements, exhibiting ultra-low loss operation and sub-angstrom fabrication precision, making it an excellent platform for AHS. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first topologically nontrivial photonic SNAP devices by coupling together axial modes of adjacent SNAP microresonators to form a variety of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. The devices manifest numerous distinct topological band structures corresponding to each axial mode of the microresonators, enabling us to observe behavior both close to and far from the topological-trivial phase transition. We further expand the scope of topological SNAP systems to contain not just higher-order generalizations of SSH lattices, but junctions between multiband lattices with dissimilar topological phases created by coupling up to 21 uniform and well-matched SNAP microresonators. Analyzing such \"heterojunctions\" necessitated our development of generalized topological polarization methods. We thus demonstrate the exceptional promise of the SNAP platform for AHS of 1D topological insulators, and also open the door to the potential for simulating >2 dimensional systems by utilizing nonlinear interactions."}

In this work, we establish an analytically tractable class of Fabry-Pérot metacavities in which the reflecting elements are realized by single-layer periodic arrays of circular dielectric cylinders acting as metamirrors. Both the reflection efficiency and reflection phase of such metamirrors are obtained in closed form and shown to be widely and independently tunable, encompassing ideal electric and magnetic mirror limits with unit reflectivity. Building on these results, we derive explicit analytical expressions that fully describe the optical responses of Fabry-Pérot cavities composed of two such parallel metamirrors. Our combined analytical and numerical investigations reveal that these metamirrors provide exceptional flexibility for tailoring Fabry-Pérot resonances across a broad spectral range, enabling precise control over resonance positions and quality factors. In particular, the framework naturally predicts the emergence of Fabry-Pérot bound states in the continuum with formally infinite Q-factors. These results establish dielectric-metamirror-based Fabry-Pérot cavities as a versatile and fundamentally transparent platform for engineering high-Q optical resonances."}

When the refractive index varies periodically in time, multiple time-refractions and -reflections interfere, giving rise to photonic time-crystals (PTCs). Importantly, PTCs display momentum bands separated by gaps in which the modes experience exponential amplification, drawing energy from the modulation in a non-resonant fashion. Ordinary nonlinear optics does not operate in this regime: the material response is either very weak or very slow. One of the immediate consequences is that time-reflection of light at optical frequencies has never been observed in experiments. Here, we experimentally realize an order-unity change in the refractive index occurring at sub-cycle rates, and explore the phenomena emerging from it. By varying the duration of the index change from extending over many cycles to being significantly below a single cycle, we observe that the frequency shift of the time-refraction is enhanced as the index variation occurs faster. Our experiment is the gateway for realizing sharp time-interfaces at optical frequencies, which are the key for experimenting with time-reflection, PTCs and new phenomena expected from light-matter interactions in time-varying media."}

Yet enantiosensitive optical responses are very weak. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework in which a chiral optical cavity under strong coupling directly lifts the degeneracy of opposite enantiomers at the electronic-dipole level. The cavity's parity-breaking field inside the cavity induces distinct site-energy shifts for left- versus right-handed molecules, producing robust enantioselective polariton states that overcome the weakness of traditional chiroptical effects. Using cavity quantum electrodynamics simulations, we show that strong light-matter coupling reshapes the polaritonic energy landscape and leads to enantiomer-specific coherence lifetimes and relaxation pathways. To reveal these dynamics, we propose ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) as a probe, capable of resolving polaritonic splittings on femtosecond timescales. Simulated 2DES spectra exhibit unambiguous enantioselective signatures of the cavity-induced asymmetry. These findings establish that chiral cavities provide a powerful platform for detecting and controlling molecular handedness beyond the limits of conventional optical methods."}

We present a comparative study of two spectral tailoring approaches using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS): the prepulse and double-pulse (DP) methods. In the prepulse scheme, a high-intensity pulse induces Rabi oscillations, modulating the 2D spectral amplitude and lineshape when its spectral bandwidth matches the ensemble full width at half maximum (FWHM). To overcome this limitation, the DP method employs variable inter-pulse delay to generate predetermined periodic spectral modulation without bandwidth constraints. Moreover, tuning the relative phase between DP pulses allows selective switching of frequency components, enabling controlled enhancement or suppression of distinct spectral features. These observations highlight that, while the prepulse approach is constrained by spectral bandwidth, the DP method provides a more versatile and reliable route to manipulate the coherent optical response of inhomogeneous ensembles. We are hoping these findings might stimulate further research in optical switching and coherent storage for quantum memory devices using inhomogeneous ensembles."}

Here, we explore the potential of ultrashort hard x-ray pulses for driving magnetic dynamics. We use a transient grating technique in which a spatially periodic x-ray excitation pattern gives rise to material excitations at a well-defined wave vector, whose dynamics are monitored via diffraction of an optical probe pulse. The excitation of a ferrimagnetic gadolinium bismuth iron garnet film placed in an external tilted magnetic field by x-rays at the Gd L3 edge results in both magnetic and non-magnetic transient gratings whose contributions to the diffracted signal are separated by polarization analysis. We observe the magnetization precession at both longitudinal acoustic and spin wave frequencies. An analysis with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation indicates that the magnetization precession is driven by strain resulting from thermal expansion induced by absorbed x-rays. The results establish x-ray transient gratings as a tool for driving coherent phonons and magnons, with the potential of accessing wave vectors across the entire Brillouin zone."}

The research combines both experimental and theoretical investigations, utilizing the differential microwave dielectrometry method and numerical modeling with COMSOL software. Complex permittivity (CP) values dependence of IgG water solutions on the protein concentration was experimentally obtained at the microwaves using original microwave dielectrometer setup. It was shown that increase of IgG concentration resulted in the CP values of the solutions studied decrease. The experimentally obtained CP data for the IgG water solutions were used as a basis for microwave metal-dielectric metasurface unit cell numerical modeling. The metal-dielectric metasurface consisting of Teflon substrate and plane copper microresonators was combined with a standard 96-well microplate used in clinical laboratories. Optimization of the obtained metasurface unit cell revealed that the size and position of the copper microresonators within the unit cell significantly impact the sensor sensitivity for determining the IgG concentration in aqueous solutions. The metasurface with the unit cell containing four copper microresonators provided the most sensitive platform for detecting variations in the IgG concentration in the sample. The frequency shift of the reflection coefficient was directly related to changes in the protein concentration. The calibration graph was developed for effective determination of IgG concentrations in the aqueous solutions."}

A unit cell of the proposed metasurface consists of a thin flexible dielectric substrate layer with a centrally positioned graphene microstrip. As a result of numerical modeling of spectral properties of the metasurface by COMSOL Multiphysics software in terahertz range from 5 to 35 THz the absorption spectrum maxima (resonance modes) are revealed. The following stages of the study demonstrate that placement of a layer of tested liquid sample (water or Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) solution) on the metasurface causes a low frequency shift of the plasmonic resonance mode chosen for biosensing measurements. This frequency shift, along with the change in the amplitude of the absorption peak, are highly sensitive to the refractive index of the tested liquid sample. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the developed metasurface-based sensor with graphene microstrips for application as a sensing structure to determine proteins and other biomolecules in liquid samples."}

In this work, we investigate a novel multi-blade optical ``injector'' that permits more effective and more scaleable pumping. The reported work encompasses an interdisciplinary mix of conceptualization, simulation, crystal growth, fabrication, and microwave engineering. Our gain medium is pentacene dissolved as a solid solution with para-terphenyl (Pc:PTP) molecular crystal. We accurately determine this pentacene's molecular absorption cross-section as a function of wavelength. Ray-tracing is then used to assess how different designs of waveguide inject light into the Pc:PTP crystal. A multi-blade injector made of high-refractive-index glass (namely Ohara S-TIH6) is predicted to pump it more completely and uniformly than previous designs. Upon hand-fabricating such an injector and Bridgman-growing a crystal of 0.1% Pc:PTP over it, an experimental maser oscillator using this combined injector-crystal assembly is demonstrated. The performance and scaleability of multiblade injection vis-a-vis alternative strategies is analyzed."}
