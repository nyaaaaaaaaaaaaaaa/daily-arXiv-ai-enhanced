While the efforts over the first decade focused on proof of concept devices designed and fabricated in university labs, the focus over the past 5-10 years has shifted towards implementation of scalable photonic systems. This article reviews this recent progress, challenges and new directions in photonics inverse design, thus providing a complementary and updated review of the field. We focus on large scale three dimensional photonic inverse design, including metasurfaces, translation of inverse design to commercial foundries and practical silicon photonics, application of photonic inverse design to different materials systems, wavelengths, and optical effects, and finally new directions such as inverse design of quantum systems."}

The model may be realized in the spatial domain for bulk optical waveguides, the spatiotemporal domain for optical cavities, and for effectively two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. The setup supports single- and multi-ring necklace vortex patterns, including monopoles, dipoles, tripoles, quadrupoles, pentapoles, sextupoles, octupoles, and 12-poles. In contrast with the inherent instability of conventional vortex beams with high topological charges (winding numbers), vortex necklace-shaped solitons with large winding numbers are found to be stable in the present setup. In particular, octupoles exhibit stable breathing dynamics, and 12-pole necklaces with high winding numbers may be stable. These findings provide a new way for generating stable vortex necklaces, offering a vast potential for manipulations of complex spatiotemporal light fields."}

However, designing these biosensors with simultaneously critical properties of low lasing threshold, high spectral purity, and ultimate sensitivity remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile strategy to build liquid photonic molecules (LPMs) that combine all these features in a single device. We find that through tailoring the spectral Vernier overlap in size-mismatched droplets, this device enables single-mode lasing with a low threshold of ~610 nJ mm-2. The LPM lasers are engineered for dynamic tunability using a molecular isomerization strategy, which induces spectral mode hopping and thus yields a nearly ten-fold enhancement in spectral sensitivity over single droplets. Moreover, by leveraging the self-referenced intensity response of the LPM lasing modes, we demonstrate a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in biomolecular sensing, with a detection limit of 30 aM and a dynamic range spanning nine orders of magnitude. Our work offers exciting prospects for bio-integrated liquid sensors in diverse applications."}

Due to this special property, light springs result into a rotating pulse when intercepting a plane lying orthogonal to their propagation direction. Associated to this, we introduce here the orbital group velocity, an additional tunable property of light springs. The orbital group velocity quantifies the speed of the light spring intensity rotation, distinctly from the conventional longitudinal group velocity, which describes the motion of the wavepacket envelope along its propagation axis. We demonstrate experimentally by tunable Fourier synthesis that the orbital group velocity can assume sub- and superluminal values, thus becoming a new platform for synthetic motion studies and control of laser-matter interactions. Particularly, in the superluminal regime, when interacting with a thin overdense plasma, we reveal by particle-in-cell simulations that the light spring unlocks superradiant radiation, due to the coherent excitation of the electrons in the plasma acting as a quasiparticle. This superradiant source inherits the ultrafast temporal dynamics of the light springs while emitting in the terahertz region, thus creating a new source of terahertz radiation controlled by the properties of spatiotemporal coupling of the laser. Therefore, spatiotemporal tuning of light springs is at the frontier of controlling laser-matter interaction and generating new tunable sources of radiation."}

We also quantitatively compare the topological robustness of bilayer and trilayer configurations under spatiotemporal perturbations.

In particular, inverse design of microring resonator-based sensors requires accurate modelling of geometry-spectrum relationships while satisfying physical constraints such as resonance conditions and spectral sensitivity requirements. In this work, we propose a physics-informed graph neural network (PI-GNN) for the inverse design of a microring resonator biosensor operating in the 1550 nm band. By representing the photonic structure as a graph and embedding resonance-based physical constraints directly into the learning objective, the model captures both structural connectivity and underlying electromagnetic principles. The proposed approach enables efficient prediction of device geometries that achieve target spectral characteristics, reducing reliance on costly simulations while maintaining physical consistency and competitive design accuracy."}

Remarkably, the entire optical system remains fixed with no trainable parameters or electronic feedback, yet this single physical configuration achieves competitive performance across diverse temporal and spatiotemporal learning tasks: chaotic time-series forecasting, human action recognition, steering angle prediction, and surgical skill assessment. Our results show that recurrent temporal processing can emerge directly from spatiotemporal wave dynamics.

In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications."}

First-principles calculations are used to obtain composition-specific refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) spectra, which are directly implemented into three-dimensional FDTD simulations of a complete PeLED stack incorporating Ag/SiO$_2$ core--shell nanostructures. Among the investigated compositions, Cs$_3$Cu$_2$Cl$_5$ demonstrates the strongest plasmonic response, achieving a 4.4$\\times$ Purcell enhancement and 30\\% light extraction efficiency (LEE) using optimized nanorods.

Cs$_3$Cu$_2$I$_5$ requires a nanosphere geometry and shows limited enhancement, with LEE restricted to 10%.

While polarization- and space-division-multiplexing have substantially increased the capacity of classical optical systems, their extension to coherent and reconfigurable photonic memories remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-spin-channel-multiplexed photonic memory based on chiral stimulated Brillouin scattering in a chiral photonic crystal fiber. Exploiting the intrinsic preservation of circular polarization in the chiral photonic crystal fiber, left- and right-circularly polarized modes serve as two orthogonal and independent storage channels. Multiple optical data pulses can be selectively or simultaneously stored and retrieved by simply controlling the polarization states of the write-read pulses. The storage time is continuously tunable, and the underlying Brillouin process preserves coherence and channel orthogonality. The result establishes chiral Brillouin scattering as an effective mechanism for spin-channel-multiplexed optoacoustic light storage, providing a robust and scalable platform for multidimensional photonic memories. It also open new opportunities for classic and quantum information processing, reconfigurable quantum networks, and hybrid light-matter interfaces based on coherent acoustic excitations."}
