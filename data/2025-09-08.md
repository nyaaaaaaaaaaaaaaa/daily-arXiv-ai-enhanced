*Shubhanshi Sharma,Monica Pradhan,Aviad Katiyi,Alina Karabchevsky,Shailendra Kumar Varshney*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 基于MXene和硅纳米磁洞面的混合元表面设计，通过连续体中绑定态(BIC)机制实现高响应品质因子和高吸收率，用于甲烷气体检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MXene材料在光子学应用中的损耗问题，利用BIC物理实现强光限制效果，为高敏感度传感应用提供方案。

Method: 设计了两种混合元表面结构，组成包含硅纳米磁洞面和MXene。通过SiO2间隔层实现动量匹配，激活对称保护BIC机制，以碰洞磁极子(MD)为主导多极子。

Result: 在1650 nm附近获得响应平均品质因子约150，吸收率超过90%。大能测得刷射折射敏感度为171 nm/RIU，因数FOM=17.56 RIU⁻¹；使用Cryptophane-E层时甲烷气体检测敏感度为0.8 nm/每百分比江度。

Conclusion: 该混合元表面设计通过BIC机制有效克服了MXene的损耗问题，实现了高品质因子和高敏感度的光学响应，在甲烷气体检测方面具有很好的应用前景。

Abstract: Strong light confinement is highly necessary for various applications,
including sensing. MXene, a novel and emerging material with a broadband
plasmonic response, has been highly utilized in electronic sensing systems, as
well has garnered significant attention for its applicability in photonics. The
loss imparted by MXene can be overcome through the Bound States in Continuum
(BIC) physics. In this work, we report two important designs of a hybrid
metasurface, comprising a silicon nanodisk metasurface and MXene. In both
designs, narrow and high absorption resonance of quality factor of $\sim$150 is
attained, where MD is the dominant multipole, governed by symmetry-protected
BIC. Both hybrid metasurface designs are optimized to exhibit narrow resonance
in the vicinity of 1650 nm with an absorption greater than 90 $\%$. The origin
of high absorbance in such a hybrid metasurface is attributed to the momentum
matching by the spacer layer of $SiO_2$. The spectral characteristics of the
designed metasurface can be utilized for first overtone spectroscopy of Methane
gas. Numerical simulations yield a bulk refractive index sensitivity of 171
nm/RIU with FOM = 17.56 $RIU^{-1}$ and sensitivity for Methane gas, S = 0.8 nm
per unit percentage concentration, when a Cryptophane-E layer is used.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 通过聚合物基光学氛洞增强碳维碳甲烷和hBN纳粒的光臭光射，实现了中央空隙缩小效应和普尔塞增强，显著提高了碳维碳甲烷的磁场效慢度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异质结构碳材料中的光臭光射色心是重要的纳粒量子传感器，需要开发可扩展的集成方法来提高其敏慢度和实现大规模部署

Method: 将碳维碳甲烷和hBN纳粒嵌入聚合物基光学氛洞薄膜中，构建厚度在厚米级别的光学氛洞结构

Result: 获得了上到2.9倍的普尔塞增强效果，hBN亮度提高3倍，衰变速率提高13倍，20nm碳维碳甲烷的磁场效慢度提高4.8倍

Conclusion: 这种低成本可扩展的薄膜氛洞制造方法为高级量子传感技术的发展奠定了重要基础

Abstract: Photoluminescent color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
are powerful nanoscale solid-state quantum sensors that are explored in a
plethora of quantum technologies. Methods for integrating them into macroscopic
structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale
deployment are highly sought after. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced
photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles
(NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter
scale. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position
of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to
an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness
of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is
enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, we find a 4.8 times
improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs in thin-film cavities due to
cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL
brightness. Our study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the
fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important
step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.

TL;DR: 集成磁光子芯片中实现了高性能双偏振微莱-普罗立定波江共振器，通过Sagnac循环反射器解决了偏振相关损耗问题，达到了记录水平的质量因子和广带热调效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集成Fabry-Perot共振器在缩小尺寸下同时实现超高Q值因子和广带热调效果的挑战，特别是基础横向磁场(TM0)和横向电场(TE0)模式的偏振相关损耗问题

Method: 使用偏振不敏感的Sagnac循环反射器和多模波导来有效压制损耗，实现了硅碳化硅双偏振微莱-普罗立定波共振器

Result: 达到了记录水平的负载质量因子：TM0模式2.38×10^6，TE0模式3.48×10^5，两种模式均可在全自由谱范围内热调，调制效率分别约1.04 pm/mW和1.24 pm/mW

Conclusion: 这些进展为光学传感器、非线性光子学和集成量子光子学领域的缩小化、高性能双偏振共振器设定了新的标杆

Abstract: Miniaturized Fabry-Perot standing-wave resonators and whispering-gallery
travelling wave resonators constitute foundational building blocks for photonic
integrated circuits. While both architectures offer transformative potential
through high quality factors and dual-polarization operation, integrated
Fabry-Perot resonators face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving
ultra-high Q-factors and broadband thermal tunability for fundamental
transverse magnetic (TM0) and transverse electric (TE0) modes within a compact
footprint-primarily due to polarization-dependent losses in conventional
chip-scale reflectors. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating an
integrated silicon nitride dual-polarization micro-Fabry-Perot resonator with
polarization-insensitive Sagnac loop reflectors and multimode waveguides to
effectively suppress losses and enable high-performances for both fundamental
transverse magnetic (TM0) and transverse electric (TE0) modes. The device
achieves record loaded quality factors of 2.38*106 (TM0) and 3.48*105 (TE0)
respectively and intrinsic quality factors will be even higher. Moreover, both
two modes are tuned over the whole free spectral range of around 0.111 nm (TM0)
and 0.112 nm (TE0) with the thermal tuning efficiencies of approximately 1.04
pm/mW (TM0) and 1.24 pm/mW (TE0). These advances establish a new benchmark for
compact, high-performance dual-polarization resonators in optical sensors,
nonlinear and integrated quantum photonics.

Result: 首次实验展示ANTMs，证明其在面对混乱时仍保持稳健性，同时具有高通量拓扑运输能力

Conclusion: 这些反直觉性质显示了可任意变形非线性拓扑模式的多用性，为高度适应性拓扑设备研究平了道路

Abstract: Nonlinear topology is an emerging field that combines the intrinsic
reconfigurability of nonlinear systems with the robustness of topological
protection, offering fertile ground for unconventional phenomena and novel
applications. Recently, arbitrarily configurable nonlinear topological modes
(ANTMs) were proposed, enabling wavefunctions to be configured into arbitrary
profiles , and offering greatly enhanced capacity for topological modes and
high-throughput topological transport. Here we present the first direct
experimental demonstration of ANTMs . These nonlinear topological modes are
robust against disorder while also being continuously reshaped and reconfigured
in real time through external control. These counterintuitive properties
highlight the versatility of arbitrarily morphing nonlinear topological modes
and pave the way for highly adaptable topological devices capable of operating
reliably across diverse application scenarios, including those involving
imperfections, signal variability, and dynamic conditions.

### [5] [Impact of noise on nonlinear-exceptional-point-based sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04839)
*Kai Bai,Chen Lin,Meng Xiao*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 非线性特异点(NEPs)在噪声处理方面的理论框架发展，解决了关于信噪比的争议，为NEP基传感器技术奠定基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性特异点(NEPs)被认为可以解决线性特异点的噪声发散问题，但存在对信噪比(SNR)改善效果的疑虑，且缺乏系统化的理论框架

Method: 开发了一种新的理论框架，用于分析噪声对NEP基传感器的影响，特别考虑了本质非线性反馈机制

Result: 噪声与非线性的交互作用使平均频率基本保持不变，同时隐藏的反馈机制限制了可检测不确定性的增加，从而在NEPs处实现了显著的信噪比提升

Conclusion: 该研究解决了关于NEPs信噪比的争议，为NEP基传感器技术的发展奠定了坚实的理论基础

Abstract: Nonlinear exceptional points (NEPs), a new type of spectral singularity in
nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, are expected to address the noise divergence
issue encountered at linear exceptional points and are therefore under the
scrutiny of theoretical and experimental investigations. However, concerns have
been raised that NEPs may hinder improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of sensors, and there is currently no rigorous theoretical framework to
characterize noise effects in NEPs, particularly when accounting for the
inherent nonlinear feedback. Here, we develop a new theoretical framework to
address the impact of noise on NEP-based sensors, effectively resolving these
concerns. The interplay between noise and nonlinearity keeps the average
frequency virtually unchanged. In addition, a hidden feedback mechanism limits
the increase in detectable uncertainty, together enabling a substantial SNR
enhancement at NEPs. Our results resolve the ongoing debate over the SNR of
NEPs and lay the groundwork for NEP-based sensor technologies.

Abstract: Beam steering and beamwidth compressing play a role in steering the beam and
narrowing its half-power beamwidth, respectively, which are both widely applied
in extending the effective operational range of 6G communications, IoT devices,
and antenna systems. However, research on wave manipulation devices capable of
simultaneously achieving both functionalities remains limited, despite their
great potential for system miniaturization and functional integration. In this
study, we design and realize a broadband device capable of simultaneously
steering and compressing the TM-polarized EM waves using subwavelength
protrusion metallic tunnels. The underlying physical mechanisms are
quantitatively explained through wave optics and optical surface
transformation, indicating the size ratio between the incident and output
surface governs both the steering angle and the compression ratio. Numerical
simulations demonstrate its outstanding performance, achieving a maximum
steering angle of 40{\deg} and a compression ratio of 0.4 across 3 to 12 GHz,
with averaged energy transmittance above 80%. The experiments further validate
its effectiveness by measuring the magnetic field distributions of the output
beam at various frequencies. The excellent beam steering and compressing
effects make the proposed device highly promising for next-generation
multifunctional wave manipulation in advanced communication systems.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 通过重新利用PMMA聚合物作为光学元表面的关键材料，提出了一种简化的双层制造方法，避免传统多步高成本制造流程，实现了高品质因子的元表面形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学元表面制造需要多步复杂流程（如金属/仅电材涂层、剥离、激光刷刷等），成本高、耗时长、依赖专业设施，限制了大规模生产和可持续性。

Abstract: Optical metasurfaces supporting resonances with high quality factors offer an
outstanding platform for applications such as non-linear optics, light guiding,
lasing, sensing, light-matter coupling, and quantum optics. However, their
experimental realization typically demands elaborate multi-step procedures such
as metal or dielectric deposition, lift-off, and reactive ion etching. As a
consequence, accessibility, large-scale production and sustainability are
constrained by reliance on cost-, time- and labor-intensive facilities. We
overcome this fabrication hurdle by repurposing polymethyl methacrylate-which
is usually employed as a temporary resist-as the resonator material, thereby
eliminating all steps except for spin-coating, exposure and development.
Because the low refractive index of the polymer limits effective mode
formation, we present a bilayer recipe that enables the convenient fabrication
of a freestanding membrane to maximize the index contrast with its
surroundings. Since etching induced defects are circumvented, the membrane
features high quality nanopatterns. We further examine the suspended membrane
with scanning electron microscopy and extract its position-dependent spring
constant and pretension with nanoindentation experiments applied by the tip of
an atomic force microscope. Our all-polymer metasurface hosting Bound States in
the Continuum experimentally delivers high quality factors (up to 523) at
visible and near infrared wavelengths, despite the low refractive index of the
polymer, and enables straightforward geometry-based tuning of both linewidth
and resonance position. We envision this methodology to lay the groundwork for
accessible, high performance metasurfaces with unique use cases such as
material blending, angled writing and mechanically based resonance tuning.

TL;DR: 本文证明了双色拓扑泵浦现象，通过有理数逼近无理数频率比的方式，在有限系统中实现了准周期拓扑泵浦的可观测性。实验中使用光折变晶体和斐波那契数列逼近黄金比例，观察到光束中心的位移行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拓扑泵浦需要严格的周期性参数变化，而准周期拓扑泵浦由于需要无限演化距离，在真实有限系统中难以观测。本文旨在解决这一根本性问题，探索在有限系统中实现准周期拓扑泵浦的方法。

Result: 实验观察到光束中心在每个逼近周期内产生单周期位移，位移大小由相邻斐波那契数的关系决定，而光束的平均传播方向（模拟平均泵浦速度）由黄金比例决定。

Conclusion: 通过有理数逼近无理数频率比的方法，可以在有限系统中实现准周期拓扑泵浦的可观测性，为在真实物理系统中研究准周期拓扑现象提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Topological pumping refers to transfer of a physical quantity governed by the
systemtopology, resulting in quantized amounts of the transferred quantities.
It is a ubiqui-tous wave phenomenon typically considered subject to exactly
periodic adiabatic vari-ation of the system parameters. Recently, proposals for
generalizing quasi-periodictopological pumping and identifying possible
physical settings for its implementa-tion have emerged. In a strict sense,
pumping with incommensurate frequencies canonly manifest over infinite
evolution distances, raising a fundamental question aboutits observability in
real-world finite-dimensional systems. Here we demonstrate thatbi-chromatic
topological pumping with two frequencies, whose ratio is an irrationalnumber,
can be viewed as the convergence limit of pumping with two
commensuratefrequencies representing the best rational approximations of that
irrational number. In our experiment, this phenomenon is observed as the
displacement of a light beamcenter in photorefractive crystals induced by two
optical lattices. The longitudinalperiods of the lattices, that in the paraxial
approximation emulate two pumping fre-quencies, are related as Fibonacci
numbers, successively approaching the golden ratio. We observed that a
one-cycle displacement of the beam center at each successiveapproximation is
determined by the relation between successive Fibonacci numbers,while the
average direction of propagation (emulating average pumping velocity) ofthe
beam is determined by the golden ratio.

Abstract: Photon condensation in semiconductor microcavities is a transformative
technique for engineering quantum states of light at room temperature by
tailoring strong but incoherent light-matter interactions. While
continuous-wave and electrical pumping offer exceptional prospects for
miniaturized quantum photonic technologies, harnessing these requires
conceptual advances in understanding nonequilibrium light-matter dynamics in
semiconductors. We resolve this challenge through an \textit{ab initio} quantum
kinetic theory capturing how Coulomb interactions of optically excited carriers
and phonon scattering mediate photon thermalization and condensation in
semiconductors. Our microscopic model shows that at high carrier densities,
thermalization is dominated by carrier-carrier Coulomb scattering, in clear
contrast to the rovibrational relaxation that governs dye-based photon
condensates. The theory predicts a rich nonequilibrium phase diagram with
thermal, Bose-condensed, multimode, and lasing phases, quantitatively in
agreement with recent experiments. Crucially, we identify how cavity detuning
controls transitions between equilibrium and gain-dominated regimes, enabling
tailored design of coherent light sources. This work thus provides the
foundation for semiconductor-based quantum photonic devices operating beyond
conventional laser paradigms.

Abstract: Histochemical staining is essential for visualizing tissue architecture and
cellular morphology but is destructive and limited by the availability of
tissue for multiple stains. Virtual staining with label-free microscopy offers
a non-destructive alternative, enabling multiple stains to be generated from
the same section while reducing stain variability and preserving tissue for
downstream assays. Here, a new dual-excitation Photon Absorption Remote Sensing
(PARS) system is presented, representing the first application of long-wave
ultraviolet A (UVA) 355 nm excitation alongside the established UVC 266 nm
source. The addition of 355 nm extends PARS contrast beyond 266 nm, enhancing
stromal visualization (e.g., collagen, elastin) and capturing red blood cells,
melanin, and other features through complementary radiative and non-radiative
absorption. The 266 nm and 355 nm pulses interrogate the sample in an
interlaced fashion, enabling concurrent acquisition without compromising
imaging speed. Using the RegGAN image-translation framework, this work presents
the first demonstration of PARS virtual staining across multiple specialized
stains, including Masson's trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Jones'
silver, in addition to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), across diverse human and
murine tissues. A masked evaluation by expert pathologists showed that virtual
stains achieved the same diagnostic quality as their chemical counterparts, and
pathologists could not reliably distinguish real from virtual stains. By
providing label-free multi-stain outputs from a single scan, dual-excitation
PARS virtual staining could integrate into digital pathology workflows,
expanding diagnostic utility. Real and virtual whole-slide image (WSI) pairs
are publicly available at the BioImage Archive
(https://doi.org/10.6019/S-BIAD2232).

Abstract: Ultrafast lasers have unlocked numerous advances across science and
technology: they enable corneal surgery, reveal chemical reaction dynamics, and
underpin optical atomic clocks. Over the past decades, extensive efforts have
been devoted to developing photonic integrated circuit-based mode-locked lasers
that are compact, scalable, and compatible with further on-chip
functionalities. Yet, existing implementations fall short of pulse energies
required for their subsequent uses in nonlinear applications. In this work, we
demonstrate the first mode-locked laser that overcomes this limitation in
low-loss erbium-doped silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. The laser
is based on the Mamyshev oscillator architecture, which employs alternating
spectral filtering and self-phase modulation for mode-locking. It delivers a
176 MHz stream of pulses with nanojoule energy, comparable to fiber lasers and
surpassing previous photonic integrated sources by more than two orders of
magnitude. The output pulses exhibit excellent coherence, can be linearly
compressed to 147 fs and directly drive a 1.5-octave-spanning supercontinuum in
an integrated waveguide. Our work establishes a new generation of
high-pulse-energy photonic integrated mode-locked lasers and paves the way for
their widespread adoption.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological matter provides a platform for engineering
phenomena that go beyond the capabilities of Hermitian systems, enabling the
use of losses to engineer topological phenomena. Non-Hermitian models often
rely on artificial platforms made of engineered lattices because controlling
losses in natural compounds is challenging. Although typical models for
non-Hermitian photonic matter are often single mode, photonic systems are often
multimodal, producing mixing between different normal modes in each site. In
this work, we explore a generalized family of multimodal non-Hermitian
lattices, featuring multiple resonant modes. We show that these multimodal
models are capable of featuring topological modes and criticality, similar to
the artificial single-mode models often considered. We analyze the robustness
of these non-Hermitian topological modes to fluctuation of local losses,
disorder, and artificial gauge field. We show that these effects can be
captured via both a full microscopic model and effective multiorbital models.
Specifically, we show that due to their multiorbital nature, the localization
properties of non-Hermitian multiorbital models can be controlled by an
external gauge field. Our results demonstrate that internal orbital degrees of
freedom provide a promising strategy to engineer controllable non-Hermitian
topology and criticality.

capable of building and repairing large, complex metal parts from a wide range
of alloys. Its flexibility makes it attractive for multiple industrial
applications, e.g., in aerospace, automotive and biomedical fields. However,
errors or defects introduced at any stage of the printing process can, if
undetected, significantly impact the final result, rendering the printed part
unusable. Potential in-situ correction methods of printing defects require fast
and high-resolution on-the-fly 3D inspection inside the machine, but existing
3D monitoring methods often lack full 360{\deg} 3D coverage, require bulky
setups, or are too slow for real-time layer-wise feedback. In this paper, we
present a single-shot, multi-view polarized fringe projection profilometry
(FPP) system designed for real-time in-situ 3D inspection during DED printing.
Multiple camera-projector pairs are arranged around the deposition surface to
measure depth from different viewpoints in single-shot, while cross-polarized
image filtering suppresses specular reflections caused by varying surface
reflectance across different alloys. The final 360{\deg} reconstruction is
obtained via joint registration of the captured multi-view measurements. Our
prototype has been deployed in a DED system and our first experiments
demonstrate a depth precision better than $\delta z < 50\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ on
partially reflective and "shiny" metal surfaces, enabling accurate, layer-wise
monitoring for closed-loop DED control.

Motivation: π介子光锥分布振幅是量子色动力学中高能独占过程的关键非微扰输入，需要精确计算其Mellin矩以理解其形状特性。

Method: 在淬火QCD框架下，使用对应mπ=550 MeV的夸克质量，通过格点QCD计算第四Mellin矩的连续极限，采用次领头阶Wilson系数。

Result: 获得⟨ξ²⟩=0.202(8)(9)和⟨ξ⁴⟩=0.039(28)(11)，第一个误差为统计和系统误差，第二个为次领头阶计算的不确定性。

Conclusion: 成功计算了π介子LCDA的Mellin矩，为高能独占过程提供了重要的非微扰输入参数，结果在μ=2 GeV的MS方案下给出。

Abstract: The pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) is an essential
non-perturbative input for a range of high-energy exclusive processes in
quantum chromodynamics. Building on our previous work, the continuum limit of
the fourth Mellin moment of the pion LCDA is determined in quenched QCD using
quark masses which correspond to a pion mass of $m_\pi = 550$ MeV. This
calculation finds $\langle\xi^2\rangle = 0.202(8)(9)$ and $\langle \xi^4
\rangle = 0.039(28)(11)$ where the first error indicates the combined
statistical and systematic uncertainty from the analysis and the second
indicates the uncertainty from working with Wilson coefficients computed to
next-to-leading order. These results are presented in the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at a renormalization scale of $\mu = 2$ GeV.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨交错费米子格点理论中的对称性结构和反常行为，特别关注U(1)_F对称性在格点和连续极限中的不同表现。

Method: 通过分析交错费米子哈密顿量的守恒荷Q_F，研究其与Q_0的对易关系，构造对称质量项，并利用Ward-Takahashi恒等式验证对称性守恒。

Result: 发现格点上存在非平凡的混合反常（Q_F与Q_0不对易），但在连续极限中该反常变为平凡，可以构造同时与Q_0和Q_F对易的对称质量项。

Conclusion: 格点理论中的非平凡混合反常在连续量子场论极限中变为平凡反常，这一结果与Ward-Takahashi恒等式的格点分析相一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that the 3+1 D staggered fermion Hamiltonian
possesses, in addition to the conserved charge $Q_0$ that generates the vector
$\mathrm{U}(1)_V$ transformation, conserved charges $Q_F$ that generate the
$\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ transformations in the continuum limit, acting
simultaneously on left- and right-handed Weyl fermions in opposite directions.
Each conserved charge $Q_F$ can be regarded as the generator of a
$\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(2)_R \times
\mathrm{U}(1)_A$. One of these lattice charges satisfies the Onsager algebra.
On the lattice, the charges $Q_F$ do not commute with $Q_0$, and no symmetric
mass term exists that commutes with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$. This signals the
presence of a mixed anomaly. Remarkably, however, in the continuum limit, a
symmetric mass term commuting with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$ can be constructed. %
This implies that the non-trivial lattice anomaly becomes a trivial anomaly in
the continuum QFT. This means that the mixed anomaly that is nontrivial on the
lattice becomes trivial in the IR QFT obtained in the continuum limit, which is
consistent with the analysis of the Ward--Takahashi (WT) identity on the
lattice. Indeed, by evaluating this identity associated with the
$\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ transformation on the lattice, we confirm that
$\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ symmetry is exactly conserved.
