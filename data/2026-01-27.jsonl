The estimator is obtained from the gradient and the Hessian of the Euclidean lattice action. It is gauge invariant, configuration-based, and independent of momentum-space information. These features enable direct checks of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations. We apply this tool to compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in one, two, and four dimensions. The results confirm the proposed estimator's ability to reproduce the input temperatures across different lattice ensembles. The estimator is sensitive to sampling inefficiencies and algorithmic artifacts, making it a useful diagnostic for large-scale simulations."}

Invisible decays of heavy quarkonia are particularly promising for probing light dark matter, attracting broad interest due to their unique sensitivity.

Simulations are performed using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action across four different lattice spacings to enable a controlled continuum extrapolation. We compute the renormalized chiral condensates together with pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants for pions, kaons, and the fictitious $η^0_{s\\bar{s}}$ pseudoscalar as functions of the magnetic field strength $eB$ up to $eB\\simeq1.2$ $\\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The chiral condensates exhibit clear magnetic catalysis, increasing monotonically with the field strength. In the meson sector, neutral pseudoscalar masses decrease steadily with $eB$, whereas charged pseudoscalar masses display a non-monotonic response: they rise at small fields, consistent with the lowest-Landau-level expectation, but then saturate and slightly decrease at larger fields, signaling sizable internal-structure effects. At the same time, neutral pseudoscalar decay constants are strongly enhanced by the magnetic field. To quantify deviations from chiral symmetry relations, we isolate the magnetic-field-induced shift in the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner corrections, and find it to remain small for the neutral pion but to become sizable for the neutral kaon. To elucidate the origin of the magnetic response, we separately analyze the sea and valence quark contributions to both neutral and charged meson masses, finding that valence effects dominate at zero temperature. These results provide new insights into the interplay between QCD chiral symmetry breaking and strong magnetic fields."}

We show that the reconstruction accuracy obtained from a single measurement of the fundamental and second harmonic is comparable to that of a full two dimensional scan. We confirm the technique experimentally by compressing a 300 W, 1.3 ps, 1030 nm pulse in a hollow core fiber to 100 fs and measuring the fundamental and second harmonic spectra while scanning the second order phase in a pulse shaper before power amplification. These results establish a simple, robust, alignment insensitive live-view pulse reconstruction modality."}

Here, we report the CP-resulting square-root response to the refractive index change and enhanced sensitivity in a simple chiral Hermitian cavity without phase transitions. Because of the inherent eigenvector orthogonality, this CP-based Hermitian sensor exhibits an EP-like response and enhanced sensitivity, breaking the Petermann-factor limit of sensitivity in non-Hermitian counterparts.

However, engineering superchiral electromagnetic fields that can reliably amplify the faint signatures of chiral analytes remains profoundly challenging. Central to this difficulty is the need to balance two competing demands: maximizing the enhancement of chiral fields while maintaining a sufficiently large interaction volume for effective molecular interrogation. Here, we introduce a figure of merit (FOM) that captures the enhancement and spatial coverage of superchiral fields to benchmark different chiral-field configurations. We examine the effects of helix-geometry evolution on the FOM, including 2D to 3D chirality induction, winding-number escalation, helical-order enhancement, and transverse dilation. By tuning these structural degrees of freedom, the sensing volume can be enlarged without compromising the distribution and enhancement strength of fields. The optimized triple-strand helix markedly enhanced the analyte CD signal, yielding a FOM of 2.43*10^10 nm3, which surpassed prior 2D and 3D configurations by over an order of magnitude. The proposed FOM exhibits a strong linear correlation (R^2 = 0.9256) with the analyte CD signal. Our findings provide a systematic design framework for 3D chiral structures and a robust metric for assessing their chiroptical sensing performance, particularly in scenarios involving clusters of randomly oriented small molecules or a large chiral molecule."}

We demonstrate a record-low Vpi,DC of 2.3 to 4.3 V over a broadband MIR bandwidth from 2.4 to 3.6 um, and a 2.7 dB EO bandwidth of 40 GHz (extracted 3 dB bandwidth of 50 GHz), yielding a figure of merit of 17.4 GHz/V, more than an order of magnitude higher than the state of the art.

Here we develop an unlimited-junction detailed-balance framework for split-spectrum, multi-terminal vdW multijunction solar cells and apply it to a conservative TMD bandgap window (1.0-2.1 eV). Dynamic-programming optimization shows that the accessible bandgap window imposes a large-N efficiency limit: under full concentration, unconstrained ladders approach 84.5% at N=50, whereas the TMD window plateaus near 63.4%. This plateau is set by photons outside the gaps, so radiative quality and optics dominate beyond five junctions for realistic transfer-printed stacks. We identify an experimentally achievable N=5 ladder Eg~(2.10,1.78,1.50,1.24,1.00) eV and map each rung to candidate vdW/TMD absorbers. Using reciprocity and luminescence thermodynamics, we quantify penalties from finite external radiative efficiency, two-sided emission, and luminescent coupling, and we introduce the upward-emitted luminescence power as a computable entropy-loss proxy. Incorporating excitonic absorptance and nanophotonic thickness bounds yields practical thickness and light-management targets for transfer-printed stacks.

By breaking the vertical mirror symmetry of slab, inter-polarization coupling between TE-like and TM-like modes is activated, while intra-polarization coupling among modes within the same polarization class is simultaneously preserved. The cooperative action of these two coupling channels gives rise to the concurrent flattening of both the BIC-hosting band and the radiative band, resulting in a dual flat-band system with strongly contrasting quality (Q) factors. An effective two-step coupling model is constructed to capture the essential physics and show that the emergence of the flat bands is governed by geometric tuning rather than accidental degeneracies. The mechanism is shown to be generic with respect to polarization and material platform, enabling dual flat-band states in both low- and high-index systems, with substantially enhanced angular bandwidths in the latter. These finding establish a unified route for flat-band photonic engineering and provide a robust platform for angle-tolerant resonant photonic functionalities."}

Here, we introduce a full Poincaré vector beam-enabled balanced-injection synchronization (BIS) mechanism, which passively mitigates coupling fluctuations and preserves injection symmetry through a complementary metasurface pair, without requiring any channel estimation or active control. Over a 3.2 km urban link under moderately strong turbulence, BIS suppresses coupling power fluctuations by a factor of 4.6 (from 0.4511 to 0.0975). It eliminates desynchronization events and increases the high-quality synchronization probability from 58.6% to 91.0%. This enables a record-high bit rate-distance product of 720 Gbps \\cdot km, reducing communication interruption probability by up to 77% compared to Gaussian beam transmission.

Using a nonreciprocal microwave network with low intrinsic loss, we show that the topological antilaser preserves near-unity absorption under strong disorder, and, unlike conventional antilasers, remains functional for arbitrary placements of dissipation and input ports, even when the lattice is strongly perturbed. This robustness arises from the disorder-immune propagation and stable spatial profile of the topological edge modes.

By combining relaxed alignment constraints, compact excitation, and high-speed fingerprint-region imaging, this work establishes nanosecond NTA as a practical and scalable foundation for next-generation mid-IR chemical imaging."}

By learning the temporal signatures of Néel relaxation, this architecture reduces the Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) of spintronic Poisson bolometers by a factor of six (233.78 mK to 40.44 mK), effectively elevating room-temperature sensitivity toward cryogenic limits. We demonstrate the framework's universality across the electromagnetic and biological spectrum, achieving a 9-fold error suppression in Radar tracking, a 40\\% uncertainty reduction in LiDAR, and a 15.56 dB SNR enhancement in ECG. This hardware-inference coupling recovers deterministic signals from fluctuation-dominated regimes, enabling near-ideal detection limits in noisy edge environments."}

These effects emerge from the dynamic modulation of optical properties, which can mediate photonic transitions between eigenstates of different frequencies and/or wavevectors. To achieve such transitions, conventional approaches rely on periodic modulation schemes that demand ultrafast modulation rates and continuous energy input, posing significant practical challenges at optical frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that periodic-modulation-driven photonic transitions within the radiation continuum can be effectively mimicked using a single-period ultrafast pulse modulation, eliminating the need for sustained continuous modulation. By leveraging dispersion engineering in metasurfaces to tailor the density of states in the radiation continuum, we achieve controlled frequency transitions and theoretically demonstrate strong nonreciprocity for free-space waves as a key application. Our findings may guide future experimental research on time-varying photonics using materials such as transparent conductive oxides and semiconductors, expanding the possibilities for ultrafast and reconfigurable optical technologies. More broadly, our work may establish a practical and energy-efficient framework for dynamic photonic systems, with potential applications ranging from spatio-temporal wavefront manipulation to photonic computing and ultrafast signal processing."}

Park", "Min Seok Jang"], "title": "Data-Efficient Electromagnetic Surrogate Solver Through Dissipative Relaxation Transfer Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "In neural-network surrogate solvers for electromagnetic simulations, accurately modeling resonant phenomena remains a central challenge. High-amplitude resonances generate strongly localized field patterns that appear as outlier samples, deviating significantly from the general distribution of non-resonant cases, leading to instability and degraded predictive performance. To address this, we introduce dissipative relaxation transfer learning (DIRTL), a data-efficient training framework that integrates transfer learning with loss-regularized optimization principles from high-Q photonics. DIRTL first pretrains the model on data generated with a small fictitious material loss, which broadens sharp resonant modes and suppresses extreme field amplitudes. This smoothing of the response landscape enables the model to learn global modal features more effectively. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned on the target lossless dataset containing the true high-amplitude resonances, allowing stable adaptation based on the pretrained information. Applied to both the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and UNet architectures, DIRTL yields substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, including up to a two-fold error reduction for the FNO variant. Furthermore, DIRTL exhibits robustness across diverse training conditions and supports strong multi-task performance, underscoring the generalizability and flexibility of the pretrained core. Altogether, these results establish DIRTL as a physically grounded and architecture-agnostic curriculum for enhancing the reliability of machine-learning-based electromagnetic surrogate solvers."}

This approach enables simultaneous quantitative determination of RI for the bulk solution and the surface layer. This study utilizes the aluminum-based Kretschmann structure with the intensity interrogation technique. We construct the field-weighted model governed by the evanescent field penetration depth to decompose the SPR reflected intensity into the bulk and surface responses. Experiments are conducted using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution to form a surface adsorbed protein layer, and different concentrations of BSA are tested. Results show that the separated surface response fits well with the Langmuir formula, representing a significant improvement over the untreated SPR signal. The bulk and surface responses are then incorporated into the field-weighted model to determine the RI values of the bulk BSA solution and the surface adsorbed BSA layer at various concentrations. The experimental results of BSA solution match the Abbe refractometer measurements with a maximum error 0.0004 in RI, while the results of the adsorbed BSA layer, both the RI and thickness, aligned well with reported parameters for a single BSA layer. This method eliminates the stage rotation in the common angular interrogation SPR technique and complicated optical design and nano-fabrication in the nano-optics sensing schemes, making it suitable for compact, low-cost SPR platforms for practical applications needing surface layer characterization."}

By leveraging nonlinear spectral broadening followed by phase conjugation, this method enables sophisticated linewidth narrowing in fiber amplifier, resulting in narrow linewidth output and enhanced SBS threshold. Using a low-cost fiber oscillator as the seed source, we achieve a spectral compression ratio exceeding 3 times.

Moreover, the multi-soliton laser-field can be coarsely grained as a granular ensemble of limit-cycle oscillators with simple interaction rules derived from fine-scale physics. The self-organization of the multitude of solitons in the mode-locked laser cavity can then be mapped into a low-dimensional dynamic model that essentially reproduced the emergent process.

Wavelength matching between the lasing cavity and the external high-Q microresonator is required to accumulate Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback. Optical fiber can provide Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback for any lasing wavelength. However, optical fibers hundreds of meters or even kilometers long are required for the accumulation of Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback, hindering the integration of narrow linewidth lasers. Here, we present an integrated scheme that collects distributed feedback signal with weak wavelength dependence by exploiting surface radiation in a silicon waveguide. The effects of waveguide width on the intensities of the surface radiation and distributed optical feedback signal are first numerically analyzed by introducing a collection coefficient. Numerical calculations show that a 1 μm-wide strip waveguide yields optimal performance for excitation and collection of distributed optical feedback, which is also experimentally verified by measuring the feedback signal with an optical frequency-domain reflectometry. Benefitting from the enhanced distributed optical feedback that is 34.72 dB higher than that in a single-mode fiber, the hybrid integrated laser demonstrates an intrinsic linewidth of 1.52 kHz, a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 74.71 dB, and a frequency noise of 24.44 Hz2/Hz.

The laser employs two semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) centered at 1420 nm and 1550 nm, which are connected into a single ring resonator via polarization multiplexing. Wavelength selection and tunability is realized using an ultra-broadband tunable filter based on a blazed grating. To suppress side longitude modes, an 18-meter-long femtosecond-laser-empowered random scattering fiber is utilized inside the cavity as a feedback medium, yielding an output linewidths between 1.54 kHz and 2.61 kHz. Benefited from the fast response of the galvanometer mirror and short relaxation time of SOAs, wavelength switching time is less than 1 ms under different tuning channels among the wavelength range of near 300 nm.

Because this effect has traditionally been studied in isotropic media where the spin is aligned with the ray trajectory, it has become commonly assumed that this spin-redirection Berry phase requires nonplanar rays. Here we show that a spin-redirection phase can in fact arise along a planar ray if the spin evolves along the ray. We expose this effect through the singular example of a moving unmagnetized plasma, and demonstrate how this behavior can more generally arise from a finite transverse spin.
