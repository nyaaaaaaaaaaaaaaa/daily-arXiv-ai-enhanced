However, it can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, highlighting the need for robust diagnostics. Existing checks, such as monitoring drift distributions, are useful but indirect. We propose a complementary test based on the configurational temperature, constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based criteria, this estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and provides a physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. Using one-dimensional PT-symmetric models, we show that it reproduces the input temperature with high precision and sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. While demonstrated in simple systems, the method extends naturally to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories. Since temperature is tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring can also provide an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our results indicate that configurational temperature can enhance CLM reliability across a broad range of applications, including lattice QCD at finite density."}

While ODT is well established for imaging thin, weakly scattering samples, it encounters significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous, strongly scattering thick samples such as tissues and organoids. In this work, a novel common-path interferometric approach to ODT is presented, specifically designed for the RI reconstruction of heterogeneous and highly scattering samples at high temporal stability. The proposed technique, termed lateral shearing (LS)-ODT, incorporates partial lateral shearing off-axis interferometry to suppress the effects of multiple scattering, similar to the mechanism in differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, which is widely used for imaging thick specimens. Additionally, the LS-ODT system uses dynamic speckle illumination to enhance both spatial phase and RI sensitivity compared to laser-based ODT systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on a cell phantom. Its robustness and accuracy are further validated across a wide range of samples, including mouse kidney tissue sections and brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in both thin and thick sections. Furthermore, correlative fluorescence and RI tomography of the organoids highlights the potential of LS-ODT to enhance and support a broad spectrum of biomedical studies, particularly in the field of histology."}

A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility."}

Various imaging approaches have been developed, including point-scanning, line-scanning and wide-field microscopes, however the effects of their different temporal sampling methods on signal fidelity have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz."}

However, the experimental validation of robust inter-cell interactions in Moire photonic structures and the modulation of flatbands for specific photonic applications remain challenging. Here, we propose a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity and demonstrate nanolasers enabled by strong flatband coupling. In contrast to a twist-angle Moire cavity, a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity provides a stable flatband frequency and a substantial enhancement in Q factor compared to an isolated single-cell cavity, as the unit-cell size decreases. The photonic band-structure measurement of the small-unit-cell Moire cavity by photoluminescence reveals pronounced flatbands. Cell-resolved spectroscopy further confirms the presence of flatbands by identifying resonant peaks that consistently emerge across unit cells in a Moire cavity with a lattice mismatch of 102 nm, but not in a larger-unit-cell Moire cavity with a mismatch of 60 nm. Furthermore, mode selection is achieved by reducing the center-hole size, thus isolating the hexapole mode from the degenerate dipole modes while maintaining strong inter-cell coupling. Consequently, we demonstrate a low-threshold hexapole flatband laser in a single mode. Therefore, the systematic modification of the relative lattice parameters of the two constituent lattices offers a promising strategy for developing Moire nanolasers and flatband nanophotonic devices."}

Experimental demonstrations on point-cloud and 2D/3D holograms achieve up to 99% suppression of the ZOD intensity, without loss of image quality or field of view. Once calibrated, the correction can be applied to any hologram without recomputation, enabling real-time operation and robust performance over time. This method removes a long-standing barrier to the practical deployment of full-field holography, facilitating the development of compact, high-fidelity holographic engines for augmented and mixed reality displays."}

With resonances exhibiting high quality factors of up to 200, we demonstrate improved transmission modulation at sub-volt driving amplitudes and frequencies up to 5 MHz. Additional enhancement is achieved via ferroelectric domain alignment, resulting in up to 25 % higher modulation strength compared to the unbiased case and up to 75 % compared to previous demonstrations. This enhanced EO response, arising from the effective permittivity engineering and domain orientation in these polycrystalline metasurfaces, holds significant potential for scalable and efficient EO modulators and active metasurfaces."}

By deriving the paraxial wave equation directly in the time domain from the Helmholtz equation under an adiabatic approximation, the model remains analytically tractable while extending paraxial optics beyond time-invariant backgrounds commonly treated by frequency-domain expansions. The resulting equation preserves a Schrödinger-like structure in the presence of explicit temporal modulation and admits closed-form solutions for ultrashort Gaussian pulses. The framework supports a Green's-function description and an operator-based Hamiltonian formalism, from which an ABCD matrix representation for temporal propagation in time-varying media is obtained. The results demonstrate that temporal modulation provides an active means to control ultrashort pulse dynamics, enabling tailored evolution of pulse characteristics such as temporal width and chirp, with potential applications in ultrafast pulse shaping and a direct connection to temporal wave-packet dynamics."}

However, current mid-IR cameras require cryogenic cooling and exhibit limited pixel resolution, high cost, and restricted spectral access. Optical up-conversion provides a pathway to overcome these limitations, but existing systems typically rely on narrowband phase matching, mechanical scanning, or angular tuning, limiting imaging speed and practicality.
