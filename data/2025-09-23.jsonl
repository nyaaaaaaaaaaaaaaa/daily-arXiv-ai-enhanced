We study symmetry breaking between\nfields of opposite circular polarization characterized by a codimension-2\nbifurcation point unique to the regime of normal group velocity dispersion. We\nshow the spontaneous formation of regular dark soliton crystals separated by\nTuring patterns of alternating polarization via \"self crystallization\" due to\nlong range interactions. Frequency combs of dark soliton crystals of two\northogonal polarizations in Fabry-Perot resonators display three separate\ncomponents corresponding to the cavity repetition rate, the wavelength of the\nperiodic pattern and the soliton lattice spacing. The system also displays the\nformation of stationary and dynamical vectorial dark-bright solitons. These\nsolutions are different from previous realizations with bichromatic driving in\nring resonators, are composed of locked switching fronts and can undergo Hopf\nbifurcations when scanning the detuning. Interacting oscillating dark-bright\nsolitons display anti-phase dynamics that changes first into quasi-periodic\noscillations and then into in-phase dynamics when increasing the cavity length."}

Our approach reveals that the group delay is consistent\nbetween the various shots, resulting in an average pulse duration of 27.2 fs,\nmuch shorter than the pump pulse, and a variation of 5.5 fs (standard\ndeviation).

Confined\nwithin the same cladding, the cores of MCF have a high degree of noise\ncorrelation which can be harnessed for a variety of applications. Here, we\ninvestigate MCF as a solution to the challenging problem of quantum and\nclassical light co-existence in quantum networks by operating the quantum and\nstabilization light in separate but highly correlated cores of a 7-core MCF.\nOver 40 km of spooled fiber, we achieved 100 attosecond integrated jitter on\none core by using phase information derived from another core. This allows for\n100% duty cycle on a quantum channel while maintaining a low spurious photon\nrate from crosstalk between stabilization and quantum channels. With\ncycle-slip-free stabilization over 6 hours, frequency detuning between\ndesignated stabilization and quantum channels, and an additional 40 dB\nrejection of noise photons provided by the low optical crosstalk between cores,\nwe achieved a Raman scattering-induced spurious photon rate of only 0.01\nphotons/s in 100 GHz bandwidth. Our results with MCF are a promising approach\nto ultra-stable quantum networks with 100% duty cycle on the quantum channel."}

In this Letter, we present a new spectroscopy technique for\ndetecting the chirality of spherical objects based on measuring the Stokes\nparameters at any non-forward angle. The chirality measure we introduce\neffectively eliminates achiral background noise and is independent of both the\nobject's concentration and the optical path length.

Here,\nwe present the first monolithically integrated silicon photonic chip that\nbridges microwave and optical domains for dual-band free-space communications\nand dynamic beamforming. The chip integrates a microwave true time delay (TTD)\nbeamforming network, an optical phased array (OPA) beamforming network, and an\noptical coherent transceiver, all on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. By\nuniting the strengths of microwave resilience, optical bandwidth, and coherent\ndetection sensitivity, this photonic integrated circuit represents a critical\nstep toward reconfigurable, interference-resistant, high-throughput links for\nsatellites, UAVs, and ground stations. Experimental demonstrations confirm\ntwo-dimensional dynamic beam steering in both bands 24.9 deg x 18.5 deg at\nmicrowave frequencies and 10 deg x 4.7 deg in the optical domain. In a 5-meter\nfree-space link, the chip achieves error-free transmission at 10 Gbps for\nmicrowave and 80 Gbps per wavelength in the near infrared band. These results\nestablish integrated microwave photonics as a promising platform for bridging\nEarth and orbit through compact, dual-band, beamforming-enabled transceivers."}
