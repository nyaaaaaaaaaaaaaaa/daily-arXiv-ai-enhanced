Since the emergence of GPUs for general-purpose, mixed-precision algorithms that combine single-precision (FP32) with double-precision (FP64) arithmetics have become widely used in this field and others. While FP32-based methods are now well established, we examine the practicality of using FP16. In this work, we introduce rescaling steps in both the outer iterative refinement step and the inner BiCGStab solver to avoid numerical instability. In our experiments with a simple Wilson kernel, the solver shows improved stability, and the additional iteration count compared to the FP64 version remains within 20\\%, indicating that the FP16 version is practical for use. We believe that the proposed rescaling methods can also benefit other mixed precision preconditioners in avoiding underflows."}

Springer, Cham", "summary": "Lattice simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) enable one to calculate the low-energy properties of the strong interaction among quarks and gluons based on the first principle. The most time-consuming part of the numerical simulations of lattice QCD is typically solving a linear equation for the quark matrix. In particular, a discretized quark formulation called the domain-wall fermion operator requires a high numerical cost, while retaining the lattice version of the chiral symmetry to good precision. The domain-wall operator is defined on a five-dimensional (5D) space extending the four-dimensional (4D) spacetime with an extra fifth coordinate. After solving the linear equation in 5D space, the result vector is projected onto the original 4D space. There is a variant of the domain-wall operator that improves the convergence of the 5D linear equation while unchanging the 4D solution vector. In this paper, we examine how this variant of the domain-wall operator accelerates the iterative linear equation solver in practical setups. We also measure the eigenvalues of the operator and compare the condition number with the convergence of the solver. We use a generic lattice QCD code set Bridge++ that is planned to be released including the improved form of the domain-wall operator examined in this work with code for the GPU."}

As a first application, we employ $κ_{AB}$ to investigate the relative strength of $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry breaking in $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD using optimal domain-wall fermions at the physical point. Our study covers three lattice spacings and twelve temperatures in the range 164-385~MeV. We examine three independent symmetry-breaking channels in the nonsinglet sector with connected correlators: the $U(1)_A$-sensitive scalar-pseudoscalar channel ($κ_{PS}$), probing the $π$-$δ$ system; the $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$-sensitive vector--axial-vector channel ($κ_{VA}$), probing the $ρ$-$a_1$ system; and an additional $U(1)_A$-sensitive tensor--axial-tensor channel ($κ_{TX}$), probing the $ρ$-$b_1$ system. At finite lattice spacing, we observe a clear hierarchy $κ_{PS} > κ_{TX} \\sim κ_{VA}$. A controlled continuum extrapolation reveals that this hierarchy collapses, with all three symmetry-breaking strengths becoming statistically indistinguishable within our precision. This result provides a new, model-independent benchmark from a chirally symmetric lattice action. Our findings indicate that the effective restoration scales for $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ in the nonsinglet sector converge closely near the chiral crossover, placing stringent quantitative constraints on the temperature window for chiral and axial symmetry manifestation in connected channels. These results support a two-stage restoration scenario, in which full symmetry restoration -- including the singlet sector -- occurs only at significantly higher temperatures once topological fluctuations are suppressed."}

This problem is pronounced in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where strong mutual inductance between a receive coil (RC) and a metamaterial (MM) degrades B1 performance. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian complex-coupling decoupling strategy based on a dual-resonator model. By engineering a phase delay in the coupling pathway, an imaginary coupling component is created, driving the system from the PT-symmetric to the anti-PT-symmetric phase and enabling eigenmode degeneracy without added dissipation. Implemented through a high-permittivity ceramic layer, this mechanism restores single-mode resonance in the MM - RC system and suppresses frequency splitting. Simulations show a ~14-fold B1 enhancement compared with the strongly repulsive regime. This passive, compact, and hardware-compatible approach offers a general route for coupling control in electromagnetic, acoustic, optical, and quantum systems."}

Representatives of these defects act as bright single photon sources, spin-1 systems, and multiproperty atomic-scale sensors. They are predominantly investigated in bulk hBN films, where defects are decoupled from surface and interfacial effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of surface defects optically active in the green/yellow visible spectral range, which exhibit photophysical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts. High-power resonant laser illumination quenched the emission from the ensemble of such defects, which was attributed to a light-driven structural reconfiguration. The quenched defects were found to recover their emissive capabilities via a thermal cycling process, revealing an activation energy of 24.5 meV for the structural transition. Alternatively, permanent quenching of the defects was triggered by surface chemistry, involving lithiation-enabled attachment of functional groups. These mechanisms were utilized to realize negative-contrast direct laser writing, designing arbitrary geometric emissive patterns on demand in a microscopic configuration. The surface-active radiative centers in hBN appear particularly attractive for exploring environmental sensitivity, surface science, and coupling to photonic structures or electronic devices by taking unique advantage of the two-dimensional characteristics of the host lattice."}

Among them, spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) offer compact, room-temperature hardware with inherently parallel, energy efficient, single-shot optical evaluation of the Ising Hamiltonian. However, scalability has been fundamentally limited by optical aberrations and non-uniform illumination, which corrupt phase-based spin encoding and distort coupling representation, forcing operation to a restricted spatial light modulator (SLM) region. Here we introduce a high-precision full-aperture calibration scheme that overcomes these constraints. By implementing wavefront retrieval and correction with < λ/40 accuracy, we restore faithful phase encoding across the entire SLM area. Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction-normalization method, which compensates for amplitude curvature and enables uniform coupling representation. Together, these advances establish a high-fidelity, full-area SPIM architecture that unlocks true scalability and enables larger and more reliable photonic Ising computations."}

Single-pulse energies of 2.7 nJ and 1.5 nJ are achieved for the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, respectively. Furthermore, the all-fiber configuration exhibits superior noise performance and inherent common-mode noise suppression. To facilitate broadband and high-speed dual-comb spectroscopy, we employ a dynamic repetition rate difference control technique via pump power modulation, enabling zero-crossing dynamic scanning. This approach achieves a spectral measurement bandwidth of approximately 16 nm at an acquisition rate of 500 Hz. Compared to static operation, this represents a nearly two-order-of-magnitude improvement in acquisition speed and achieves a fivefold measurement bandwidth beyond the Nyquist aliasing limit. Experimental results demonstrate that the system maintains robust coherence even under dynamic modulation. By implementing a phase-correction algorithm, a mutual coherence time of 0.5 s is successfully achieved, yielding a spectral resolution exceeding 7.2 GHz.

Here, we present an end-to-end generative framework that couples the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a differentiable ray-tracing engine to democratize the synthesis of diffraction-limited optical prescriptions. By treating optical design as a semantic-to-physical translation task, the system autonomously interprets prompts ranging from high-level end-user requests to rigorous technical specifications. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across three distinct regimes: (1) finite-conjugate industrial metrology systems, where the model autonomously enforces application-specific constraints such as telecentricity to achieve diffraction-limited performance; (2) a suite of infrared objectives (NIR, SWIR, and LWIR), demonstrating the framework's ability to synthesize valid topologies and optical prescriptions for non-visible spectral bands, and (3) complex aspheric mobile lenses, where the system successfully navigates the high-dimensional optimization landscape to produce high-resolution designs suitable for modern sensors. Validated against industry-standard simulation tools, these results establish a new paradigm for automated optical engineering, bridging the gap between semantic intent and physical realization."}

Dual-comb spectroscopy, enabled by the development of these frequency comb sources, allows broadband absorption measurements of complicated spectra, exceeding the limitations of direct, single-comb spectroscopy. To date, however, the dual-comb approach has not been able to directly access many important transitions that lie at challenging vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate dual-comb spectroscopy in the vacuum ultraviolet utilizing intracavity high harmonic generation. This multi-harmonic source is used to measure molecular absorbance spectra at $λ=210$~nm and $λ=149$~nm from room-temperature samples of acetylene and ammonia, respectively. These measurements resolve the Doppler broadened structure of congested molecular spectra with absolute frequency accuracy.

Here, we propose a novel chaotic LiDAR system based on a semiconductor vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback. By exploiting the intrinsic competition between the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, the system generates a polarization-multiplexed dynamics: a chaotic TM mode serves as the reference, while a feedback-modulated TE mode probes the target. This all-in-one source eliminates the need for external optical modulators or complex coherent detection. The system's dynamics is finely tunable via a half-wave ($λ$/2) plate in the feedback loop and the laser injection current, enabling real-time optimization of the cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results demonstrate precise linear ranging with a resolution of approximately 1.2 cm. Furthermore, the system exhibits strong inherent resistance to external optical interference, maintaining accurate ranging even in the presence of a secondary laser source.

In order to do so, we also present an approximate treatment of the problem of the transmission and reflection of light through (possibly absorptive) birefringent layers, relying on a few fundamental results that can be found in the already extensive literature on the subject. Unfortunately, many of these results remain the domain of a niche of investigators working in the field of thin films and optical coatings, and are often overlooked even by experienced designers of spectro-polarimetric instrumentation. The treatment presented in this work is limited to isotropic materials and uniaxial crystals, which are the most common types of optics employed in polarimetric instrumentation, and it fundamentally relies on the approximation of small birefringence for its implementation.

To overcome this limitation, we present near-infrared LDHM (NIR-LDHM), a in-line holographic platform that operates up to the silicon cutoff (~1100 nm) using a conventional board-level CMOS sensor designed for visible (VIS) imaging. Using tissue-mimicking milk scattering layers and calibrated resolution targets, we quantify reconstruction performance versus wavelength, scattering strength, and sample-sensor distance. NIR-LDHM maintains resolvable features through scattering layers up to ~1.4 mm, whereas visible regime fails to resolve features below ~350 um. Importantly, despite a detector quantum efficiency of only 0.19% at 1100 nm, robust reconstructions are obtained under low-photon-budget conditions. We further identify advantageous mechanism by which increasing the sample-sensor distance from ~3 to 12 mm improves lateral resolution by twofold under strong scattering. Finally, we demonstrate wide-field, label-free amplitude-phase imaging of uncleared mouse tissues, resolving internal structure in brain and liver slices up to ~250 um and ~60 um, respectively. By extending lensless complex-field microscopy into strongly scattering regimes with minimal hardware changes, this work has relevance to computational imaging through complex media and biophotonics."}

Rodríguez-Fortuño"], "title": "A robust and efficient method to calculate electromagnetic modes on a cylindrical step-index nanofibre", "comment": "7 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "The accurate calculation of guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibres is critical for applications in nanophotonics, from quantum interfaces to vectorial light sensing. Standard textbook methods rely on solving a $4\\times4$ matrix eigenvalue problem to find the modal fields. While widely used, this approach has a subtle but significant flaw: the final determination of the field amplitudes requires finding the numerical null space of a theoretically singular matrix, an ill-conditioned problem that introduces large relative errors in the small but physically crucial longitudinal field components. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally more robust and efficient semi-analytical method. By starting from the foundational symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and employing a judicious normalisation of the field amplitudes, we demonstrate that the problem can be analytically reduced to a much simpler $2\\times2$ system. This reformulation yields two decisive advantages: the dispersion relation is obtained numerically from a simple and well-behaved transcendental equation, and more importantly, the modal field amplitudes are subsequently determined \\emph{analytically}. Our approach completely bypasses the numerical null space calculation, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the full vectorial field structure. This method provides a powerful and reliable tool for the design and analysis of nanofibre-based devices, particularly for applications in chiral quantum optics and nanophotonics where precise knowledge of field polarisation and specifically of the longitudinal components is paramount."}
