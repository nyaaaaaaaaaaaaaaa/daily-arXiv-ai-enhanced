In\nthis work, we uncover the rich physics of radiative heat transfer in\nnonequilibrium, far field many body systems composed of thermal emitters that\nbreak Lorentz reciprocity. We show that the total heat flow naturally\ndecomposes into two distinct components: an equilibrium term, which generates a\npersistent circulating heat current within the system, and a nonequilibrium\nterm, which governs energy exchange with the environment. Remarkably, while the\ninternal persistent heat current is ever present, the nonequilibrium\ncontribution can be precisely engineered to achieve perfect heat rectification\nand circulation.
