Due to color confinement, these correlators decay exponentially at large spatial distances, a behavior crucial for computing momentum-space Fourier transformations with controlled errors from lattice QCD data. Using heavy-quark effective theory reduction, dispersive analysis, Lorentz symmetry, and heavy-flavor spectra, we determine the leading and next-to-leading asymptotic behaviors and relate the expansion parameters to binding energies of heavy-flavor hadrons. We demonstrate the results through two-loop calculations in $φ^3$ theory and from the perspective of locality and analyticity. We also study the impact of the asymptotic analysis on realistic lattice QCD data and demonstrate reliable error estimates."}

This focus - together with rapid advances in quantum-computing hardware - has driven increasing applications in high-energy physics, particularly in lattice gauge theories. However, most existing experimental demonstrations remain restricted to (1+1)-dimensional and/or abelian gauge theories, such as the Schwinger model and the toric code. It is essential to develop quantum simulations of nonabelian gauge theories in higher dimensions, addressing realistic problems in high-energy physics. To fill the gap, we demonstrate a quantum simulation of thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)-dimensional $q$-deformed $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$ Yang-Mills theory using a trapped-ion quantum computer. By restricting the irreducible representations of the gauge fields to the integer-spin sector of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$, we obtain a simplified yet nontrivial model described by Fibonacci anyons, which preserves the essential nonabelian fusion structure of the gauge fields. We successfully simulate the real-time dynamics of this model using quantum circuits that explicitly implement $F$-moves. In our demonstrations, the quantum circuits execute up to 47 sequential $F$-moves. We identify idling errors as the dominant error source, which can be effectively mitigated using dynamical decoupling combined with a parallelized implementation of $F$-moves."}

Here we show that the purity of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes can be protected against degradation in random media by leveraging two fundamental features of their own Schrödinger Hamiltonian dynamics, namely, Zeno effect -- frequent observations slow down the evolution -- , and Gouy phase -- the back-action of the observation. Repeated, OAM-dependent Gouy phase kicks imparted along the disturbing path by simple imaging systems trigger the optical Zeno effect that protects the input OAM mode against mode cross-talk that would broaden the OAM spectrum. Given the universality of the mechanism, the Gouy phase-assisted Zeno effect would protect propagation modes other than those of OAM, and the diverse forms of structured light built with them."}

In this work, we demonstrate a Spintronic Poisson (SP) bolometer enabling room-temperature ultra-broadband sensing across 3-14 um. Unlike conventional bolometers that rely on continuous analog signals, the SP bolometer implements a Poisson-counting detection paradigm, encoding temperature in discrete stochastic events, which turns thermal noise from a limitation into the basis of the estimator itself. We fabricate the SP bolometer using a spintronic transduction layer integrated with a plasmonic nanoantenna array to enhance broadband infrared absorption. Using spintronic transduction, the device achieves the noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD, thermal sensitivity metric) of 80-100 mK at 300 K, surpassing uncooled detectors and approaching cooled technologies. This work establishes a statistical detection paradigm for room-temperature infrared sensing with broad application potential."}

This coupling exhibits pronounced graph topological features, and we design a graph neural network (GNN) to accurately abstract its inherent physics. Through strategic enhancement of the coupling effects, the discrete metasurface responses are transformed into continuous states, thereby unlocking diverse multiplexing channels. By further integrating the GNN into an inverse design agent, we tailor the multi-channel global response of metasurface to support simultaneous multiplexing across angle, frequency, and polarization domains. Experimentally, we demonstrate a compact metasurface multiplexer with eight independent channels, showcasing its potential for next-generation vehicular networks.

However, the temporal stability remains challenged by issues like line-width broadening and high-power demand in efforts to improve it. In this work, we investigate the effect of the second-harmonic generation process on the laser characteristics under three longitudinal mode regimes: single-longitudinal-mode, dual-longitudinal-mode, and multi-longitudinal-mode. The results demonstrate that the second-harmonic generation process effectively stabilizes the temporal characteristics of the laser and enhances its correlation, leading to a temporally clean output beam. The physical mechanism of the observed temporal stabilization effect can be attributed to a high-peak-pulse attenuation effect, jointly induced by nonuniform longitudinal-mode depletion and phase preservation in the residual fundamental wave. Statistical analysis indicates that at the maximum fundamental-wave power in the multi-longitudinal-mode regime, the standard deviation and peak-to-valley values derived from the normalized temporal profile decrease from 0.6122 and 5.6846 for the fundamental wave to 0.189 and 0.8847 for the residual fundamental wave. Meanwhile, the background level of the intensity auto-correlation function rises from ~0.72 to ~0.96, revealing its evolution toward a more coherent state. To the best of our knowledge, this research presents the first demonstration of laser temporal stabilization and correlation enhancement via second-harmonic generation. It not only deepens the comprehension of second-harmonic generation mechanisms, but also opens up a new avenue for realizing temporal beam self-cleaning of light."}

Linear transmission spectroscopy reveals that, in addition to NV centers, the crystals host significant populations of H2 (NVN-) defect complexes whose absorption band partially overlaps the excitation wavelength. By correlating spectroscopic data with nonlinear measurements and modeling the response using an effective two-level system, we show that the observed saturation cannot be attributed solely to NV centers but arises from the combined contribution of NV-related and H2 defects. For the highly doped sample, we determine an effective linear absorption coefficient of alpha0 = 6.52 cm-1 and a saturation intensity of Is = 40.0 GW/cm2.

Their development has had a transformative impact on optics and physics, and they remain the central platform for both fundamental discoveries and practical photonic technologies. However, the relatively large footprint and substrate-bound nature of photonic crystal structures have so far strongly limited their use as miniature optical devices or biointegrated sensors. Here, we overcome these limitations by identifying the minimal size of a 2D photonic crystal array needed to achieve lasing and describe the fabrication of substrate-less hexagonal laser particles with an active area as small as 30 μm2. Massively parallel fabrication, robust detachment, and integration of the nanolaser particles into live cells is demonstrated. Crucially, by engineering spatial and spectral mode characteristics, we designed NIR-II probes with mode volumes on the order of tens of attolitres, an order of magnitude smaller than whispering gallery probes of similar dimensions. Such high light localization is comparable in scale to different organelles of eucaryotic cells. In the future, we expect that chemical or plasmonic functionalization of the device will enable label-free sensing of nanoscale intracellular processes, and that it shall serve as a miniature platform to exploit developments in optical and quantum sensing for chemical and biological applications."}

They also offer intrinsic anisotropic optical properties, which can be used to shape and manipulate light even inside spatially highly symmetric structures. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed optical characterization of a spherical bipolar liquid crystal polymer microlaser that tightly confines the optical path of whispering gallery modes to the equatorial plane. By controlled anchoring of the liquid crystal mesogens followed by polymerization, a fixed refractive index gradient is formed within the spherical microcavity. Consequently, only transverse electric (TE) modes oscillating in the equatorial plane experience the high extraordinary refractive index, allowing to confine lasing into a single plane. Furthermore, we observe that the refractive index gradient causes a characteristic splitting of the TE modes. By combining hyperspectral imaging and analytical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed splitting is caused by lifting of the energy degeneracy of higher order azimuthal laser modes, enabling direct insights into the complex interplay of refractive index gradients and resulting whispering gallery mode confinement. In addition, the unique ability to confine lasing of a spherical microbead into only a single plane makes these microlasers independent of the exact position of the pump beam, which allows consistent localized sensing especially in combination with fast point scanning microscopes or inside highly dynamic biological environments."}

Full-wave numerical simulation is highly desired for their design and optimization, but it is notoriously difficult, even for two-dimensional metasurfaces, when they comprise a huge number of subwavelength elements. This paper focuses on two-dimensional non-periodic metasurfaces that contain only a relatively small number of distinct subwavelength elements. We develop an efficient numerical method based on Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators, the finite element method and local function expansions. Our method drastically reduces the total number of unknowns and is capable of simulating two-dimensional metasurfaces with $10^{5}$ subwavelength elements on a personal computer. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method maintains high accuracy while offering significant advantages in both computational time and memory usage compared to the classical full-domain finite element method, making it particularly suited for the analysis of large metasurfaces."}

This gap persists even though, for more conventional light-matter interactions, the complex underlying electron dynamics can often be confined to a single Brillouin zone and described well within the dipole approximation. Previous studies were restricted to nonlinear, perturbative regimes, largely because the generation of intense ultrashort vortex pulses, particularly in the mid-infrared spectral regime, has remained a long-standing challenge. Consequently, the role of structured light in driving nonlinear, non-perturbative processes in solids, and the associated transfer of angular momentum during these interactions, has not been systematically explored. Here, we investigate solid-state high-harmonic generation (HHG) driven by intense ultrashort structured light using a versatile experimental approach applicable to different materials and geometries. We demonstrate that the OAM of the driving field is coherently transferred to the emitted harmonics. In particular, we show that the OAM is conserved independently of the crystal symmetry, the range of electronic interactions, and the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. These results establish OAM-resolved HHG as a robust framework for characterizing and controlling angular momentum transfer in solid-state HHG and open new avenues for structured-light-driven quantum technologies and topological materials investigations."}

In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory. Our findings establish a general framework for non-Hermitian higher-order photonic systems and open avenues toward tailorable topological photonic devices exploiting non-Hermitian enhanced localization."}

This method eliminates deposition-etch cycles and reduces each layer to only two fabrication steps, enabling efficient realization of multilayer architectures. Using this platform, we demonstrate multilayer q-BIC-derived metasurfaces with independently tunable resonance wavelengths and linewidths, allowing the construction of compact multi-resonant filters with spectrally decoupled layers. We experimentally demonstrate three-layer devices supporting three resonances and show independent control of resonance wavelength and Q factor across layers.

To eliminate the statistical errors due to variable and usually arbitrary sampling of the directions in a color point, we integrate the measures over a complete ellipsoid/ellipse. It turns out that in the limit for small deviations from circularity all proposed measures ($V_{AB}$, $γ-1$, $CV$ and $\\mathrm{STRESS}$) are equivalent. For greater deviations the measures become distinct with $γ-1$ the most sensitive and $\\mathrm{STRESS}$ the least. Ideally a difference measure should be coordinate independent and then it is advantageous to apply an affine transformation to both sets, e.g. turning the theoretical one into the unit ball. Although MacAdam already used this method but sampled the transformed ellipse, we integrate over the ellipsoid/ellipse. Comparing the results with the base measures we show that only $\\mathrm{STRESS}$ is coordinate independent. Judging whether a single ellipsoid/ellipse resembles a unit ball can easily be done by comparing the eigenvalues with one and we show that our previously proposed error measure $d_{ev}$ (Candry e.a. Optics Express, 30, 36307, 2022) is the eigenvalue version of $γ-1$. We show why the short lived correlation coefficient $r$ was justly abandoned, being very coordinate dependent, but that Pant's recent geometric measure $1-R$ on the other hand is coordinate independent. All measures are routinely made scale invariant by the introduction of a scaling parameter, to be optimized. Lastly we show that from all measures the $γ-1$ ones are the only ones permitting the simple derivation of the globally optimized difference measure from the locally defined ones."}

Single-photon polymerization ensures rapid polymerization of centimeter-scale structures with features on the order of tens of micrometers, whereas 2PP provides sub-micrometer features at sub-millimeter scales. Here, we introduce a hybrid unified 3D printer that leverages the complementary strengths of both printing mechanisms to bridge this scale-resolution gap. We propose integrating 2PP for high-resolution, localized spatial control with single-photon TVAM for enabling rapid, high-throughput 3D fabrication. In this approach, TVAM first forms millimeter-scale volumetric structures attached on a glass rod, via overprinting, which is then accessible for subsequent high-resolution 2PP. Without needing to change the photoresin or introducing intermediate post-processing steps, we demonstrate finely printed structures via 2PP using a tightly focused femtosecond laser beam, fabricated both inside and on the surface of the millimeter-scale 3D objects printed with TVAM. Here, TVAM contributes by generating a pre-polymerized volume that facilitates subsequent 2PP and by directly driving volumetric polymerization in designated regions within seconds. We experimentally demonstrate that this dual-mode strategy provides a scalable approach for rapidly fabricating millimeter-scale 3D structures featuring sub-micrometer details. For applications like bioscaffolds and tissue engineering, tens of micrometer-scale features are sufficient across the majority of the volume with higher resolution confined to localized functional regions. For optical component manufacturing, the distinct refractive indices of the 2PP and TVAM regions can be exploited for light propagation and other micro-optical functionalities."}
