We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\le T_{\\mathrm{loc}}\\le 158\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility."}

The results are based on an analytical solution of the linear 3D+1 paraxial amplitude equation and its application to the evolution in time of the longitudinal optical force. The current research provides valuable guidance for the development and creation of neutral particle laser accelerators with potential applications in the field of laser driven nuclear fusion."}

Brodnik", "Scott B. Papp"], "title": "Second-harmonic stabilization of a bulk photonic resonator", "comment": null, "summary": "The resonant modes of optical cavities provide a powerful resource for laser-frequency stabilization, underpinning high-precision metrology and coherent signal generation. Photonic resonators in which the optical mode propagates through material offer a compact alternative to vacuum Fabry-Perot cavity systems, but their performance is limited by sensitivity of the material to the ambient environment. In this work, we explore second-harmonic (SH) stabilization, which exploits the interplay of a dispersive mode structure against the strict energy conservation of second-harmonic generation. Operationally, we use two, 1550 nm lasers to PDH-detect octave-spaced resonant modes of an ultra-high-Q photonic resonator with one laser frequency-doubled to 775 nm. Under SH stabilization, the microwave frequency offset between the 1550 nm lasers, which we refer to as the SH signal ($f_{SH}$) maps the absolute frequency of the 1550 nm laser to an electronic signal. We characterize this mapping through comparison of the absolute optical frequency inference provided by $f_{SH}$ to an out-of-loop optical measurement, and our results suggest $f_{SH}$ accurately proxies frequency drift. We evaluate the sensitivity and noise floor of this technique, considering contributions from laser locking and bulk material properties, and conclude that $f_{SH}$ is sufficiently sensitive to enhance long-term laser-frequency stability with respect to the resonator. These results demonstrate SH stabilization as a useful technique that infers absolute drift, thereby enabling the increased stability of future compact, precision frequency references."}

Kraych", "Xavier Sarazin", "Elsa Baynard", "François Couchot", "Moana Pittman"], "title": "Reaching the quantum noise limit for interferometric measurement of optical nonlinearity in vacuum", "comment": "11 pages, 14 figures", "summary": "Quantum Electrodynamics predicts that the vacuum must behave as a nonlinear optical medium:the vacuum optical index should increase when vacuum is stressed by intense electromagnetic fields.The DeLLight (Deflection of Light by Light) project aims to measure it by using intense and ultra-short laser pulses delivered by the LASERIX facility at IJCLab (Paris-Saclay University). Theprinciple is to measure by interferometry the deflection of a low-intensity probe pulse when crossingthe vacuum optical index gradient produced by an external high-intensity pump pulse. The detectionof the expected signal requires measuring the position of the interference intensity profile with a highspatial resolution, limited by the ultimate quantum noise. However, the spatial resolution is highlydegraded by the phase noise induced by the mechanical vibrations of the interferometer. In order tosuppress this interferometric phase noise, we have developed a new method, named High-FrequencyPhase Noise Suppression (HFPNS) method, based on the use of a delayed reference signal to correctany noise-related signal appearing in the probe beam. In this work, we present the experimentalvalidation of this novel method. The results demonstrate a robust path toward picometer-scalesensitivity and provide a key step toward the observation of QED-induced vacuum refraction."}

So in this Letter we extend such an inverse method to non-Hermitian media, offering more freedom to manipulate the wave flows. Our principle of a curved-space analogue picture powered with gain and loss, is exemplified by three types: amplitude controlling, phase conversion, and direction shunting. Our numeric examples showcase precise wave manipulation in a surprisingly simple manner, which goes beyond convectional paradigms of TO and is readily implementable in realistic photonic platform."}

The method employs Digital Micro-mirror Device as a programmable amplitude modulator and reconstructs the complex optical field from multiple far-field intensity measurements using the Reweighted Amplitude Flow algo-rithm with Optimal Spectral Initialization. Unlike classical pupil-plane wavefront sen-sors, the proposed architecture does not include any wavelength-specific optical elements, enabling straightforward adaptation across a broad spectral range. The achievable spatial resolution of the reconstructed wavefront is scalable with the modulator resolution. We experimentally demonstrate wavefront reconstruction at 650 nm and at 2116 nm, where commercial wavefront sensors are not widely available. The reconstructed wavefront is validated against a commercial lateral shearing interferometer at 650 nm, and the method is further integrated into a closed-loop adaptive optics system using a deformable mirror. The approach is particularly suited for applications requiring high spatial resolution and large dynamic range in slowly varying or quasi-static laser fields, where computational reconstruction speed is not of the primary concern."}

Given the dynamics underlying the effect and the storage-release mechanism occurring for finite excitation pulses, studying and understanding the associated time dynamics are crucial for enabling future applications. In this work, we carefully investigate this phenomenon in symmetric and asymmetric geometries, shedding light on practical considerations in situations when a closed-form analytical solution is not readily available. Combinations of time domain analysis and spectral filtering are used to enable systematic analysis of these structures. Our approach can be generalized to more complex structures, including multilayered and inhomogeneous cases, providing new opportunities for optimized energy storage and advanced sensing applications utilizing complex-frequency dynamics in lossless designs."}
