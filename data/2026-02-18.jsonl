We systematically design, fabricate, and demonstrate multi-cavity, multipole integrated photonic bandpass filters with gigahertz to sub-gigahertz bandwidths. The filters feature ultra-wideband tunable center frequencies exceeding 400 GHz, ultra-low insertion loss, steep roll-off, and compact footprints, making them suitable for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave front-end applications. Using a set of design principles for multi-cavity high-order filters together with supporting nanofabrication techniques in a silicon nitride platform, the demonstrated filters achieve record-high figures of merit and advance the state of the art in integrated photonic filtering for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave systems. The resonator structures, which are the key building blocks enabling the reported performance, combine a large free spectral range of approximately 70 GHz with a high quality factor of 2.1 times ten to the power of seven. This performance is enabled by combining wide multimode waveguide segments with narrow single-mode regions connected through adiabatic tapers. To the best of our knowledge, the experimentally demonstrated bandwidth of 520 MHz, tuning range of one free spectral range, filter insertion loss of 2 dB, and out-of-band rejection ratios of up to 55 dB represent record performance metrics for integrated photonic filtering of radio-frequency, millimeter-wave, and terahertz signals."}

Inspired by the traditional TO techniques which is mostly based on the solid metamaterials with a limited range of tunability, a novel streamline tracing-based transformation optofluidics (STTOF) method is proposed to manipulate the light path by analytically designating the light-carrying streamlines of the flow in a two-dimensional circular bounded domain. A dipole flow model is built to analytically calculate the streamlines of the flow field inside the domain which allocates the optical/fluidic source and sink pairs at arbitrary positions. Liquid core/liquid cladding (L2) configuration is used in the experiment to trace the light via a specific streamline. Experimental results verify that the light paths agree well with the theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that a good range of tunability can be achieved by adjusting the flow rates and the source-sink positions of optical/fluidic source and sink pairs."}

Here we create the first fractional Skyrmions by structuring light as a vectorial superposition of non-integer orbital angular momentum. We unravel the map structure to reveal a new phenomenon, the abrupt transition jumps in skyrmion number, which serves to reinforce the integer nature of skyrmion topologies. Our experimental demonstration agrees well with simulation, opening a new spectrum of optical topologies to explore, with exciting possibilities in optical communication and sensing."}

Rev. B", "summary": "Understanding how bound states in the continuum (BICs) emerge in periodic metasurfaces is essential for the controlled design of high-Q resonances and their systematic manipulation. Here, we investigate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the effective transition matrix and the scattering matrix of periodic metasurfaces within a parameter range where the metasurface sustains a BIC. Our analysis yields general and practically applicable conditions on the singular values and singular vectors that enable BIC formation. At the BIC eigenfrequency, the inverse of the largest singular value of both matrices vanishes, and the corresponding left (right) singular vector is orthogonal to outgoing (incoming) plane waves that propagate in the directions of open diffraction orders. Our SVD-based approach predicts the spectral position of the BIC and provides detailed information about its properties, including the expansion coefficients in the multipole and plane-wave bases, as well as its behavior under perturbations that transform the BIC into a quasi-BIC. The approach is numerically validated by considering both symmetry-protected and accidental BICs in arrays of scatterers supporting electromagnetic or acoustic multipole resonances. The presented SVD framework offers a broadly applicable foundation for engineering BICs and quasi-BICs in complex metasurfaces, potentially enabling new routes for wave-based devices with tailored radiative properties."}

However, the practical deployment of inverse-designed PICs is bottlenecked by manufacturability: their irregular, subwavelength geometries are highly sensitive to fabrication variations, leading to large performance degradation, low yield, and a persistent gap between simulated optimality and fabricated performance. Unlike electronics, photonics lacks a systematic, flexible mask optimization flow. Fabrication deviations in photonic components cause large optical response drift and compounding error in cascaded circuits, while calibrating fabrication models remains costly and expertise-heavy, often requiring repeated fabrication cycles that are inaccessible to most designers. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRISM, a photonics-informed inverse lithography workflow that makes photonic mask optimization data-efficient, reliable, and optics-informed. PRISM (i) synthesizes compact, informative calibration patterns to minimize required fabrication data, (ii) trains a physics-grounded differentiable fabrication model, enabling gradient-based optimization, and (iii) performs photonics-informed inverse mask optimization that prioritizes performance-critical features beyond geometry matching. Across multiple inverse-designed components with both electron-beam lithography and deep ultra-violet photolithography processes, PRISM significantly boosts post-fabrication performance and yield while reducing calibration area and turnaround time, enabling and democratizing manufacturable and high-yield inverse-designed photonic hardware at scale."}

Heffernan", "Antoine Rolland"], "title": "Tunable microwave frequency synthesis with optically-derived spectral purity", "comment": null, "summary": "Microwave synthesizers are central to test and measurement systems across applications including wireless communications, radar, spectroscopy, and time and frequency metrology. State-of-the-art microwave sources, however, are fundamentally constrained by trade-offs between frequency tunability and spectral purity. Electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) is an emerging technique for dividing down the purity of optical sources to the microwave domain. Previously reported eOFD-based synthesizers generally have limited tunability due to feedback stabilization requirements. Here we demonstrate a feed-forward eOFD architecture in which the frequency tunability of a microwave source is preserved while optical spectral purity is divided through feed-forward cancellation, without any downstream electronic frequency synthesis. By canceling the phase noise of the microwave source without feedback, this eOFD approach removes loop bandwidth and source noise constraints observed in prior eOFD architectures. We achieve octave-spanning tunability, including the entire X-band, with phase noise below -140 dBc/Hz at kilohertz offsets and a high-frequency noise floor between -155 dBc/Hz and -145 dBc/Hz for carrier frequencies from 8 to 16 GHz. This performance corresponds to single-femtosecond integrated timing jitter, enabling, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of coherent, optically referenced microwave synthesis under wide tuning with this level of spectral purity."}
