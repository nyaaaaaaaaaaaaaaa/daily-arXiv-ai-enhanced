Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $χ^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed."}

While single-photon emission from QDs has reached a high level of maturity, the realization of high-fidelity entangled photon-pair sources remains an active and rapidly evolving frontier. In this review, we survey the recent progress in QD-based entangled photon sources, highlighting the conceptual evolution from the established biexciton-exciton cascade to the emerging paradigm of spontaneous two-photon emission. We further examine how advances in nanophotonic architectures and coherent control strategies are redefining fundamental performance limits, enabling concurrent improvements in source brightness, coherence, and entanglement fidelity. Finally, we discuss the key physical and technological challenges that must be addressed to bridge the gap between laboratory demonstrations and large-scale deployment. We conclude by outlining the future opportunities for integrating QD-based entangled photon sources into practical quantum communication, computation, and sensing platforms."}

These dynamics can often be extracted from a two-dimensional trace consisting of a set of nonlinear spectra, using an iterative algorithm. Typically, the measurement of this trace requires integrating the signal of many pulses, which implies that the trace does not correspond to a single pulse when shot-to-shot variations occur. In this case, the pulse train can be characterized statistically, by a base pulse and a metric that quantifies the instabilities. Here, we demonstrate that the amplitude swing technique is sensitive to instabilities, which manifest as two distinct imprints on the measurement. First, we analyze the terms that compose the amplitude swing signal. Then, we study two parameters to quantify the instabilities, related to a shift in the minima of the trace marginal, and to the filling of the trace minima zones, respectively. Finally, we apply these strategies to characterize simulated unstable pulse trains, using a simple technique."}

An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods."}

In this Letter, we bridge this gap by introducing a waveguide assisted non-Hermitian SSH model, in which controlled tuning of loss and coupling drives PT-symmetry breaking and enables a continuous transition between energy- and momentum-gap regimes. This allows us to construct a complete spatiotemporal topological phase diagram in a unified parameter space. By mapping this phase diagram onto a spatially graded PC, we experimentally observe multiple Bloch momentum-band gaps and a continuous spatiotemporal topological transition via translating across the static sample, enabling real-time control over the evolution pathway of the band topology. Our work creates a versatile, bias-free platform for exploring synthetic spacetime physics and opens new avenues for controlling light via non-Hermitian band engineering."}

This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform. The proposed method is compared with an alternative numerical technique. The results demonstrate a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperform the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance."}

This study proposes a novel technique for engineering the field of view of an optical system without compromising the magnification. In the proposed method, an object response pattern is recorded on a camera by introducing a coded phase mask (CPM) in the imaging system. The coded phase mask is a multiplexing of N distinct scattering phases, where N-1 represents the number of isolated object areas to be brought within the field of view. Each scattering phase yields a point spread function of a unique sparse dot pattern on the camera. With the introduction of a coded phase mask, the objects' images are brought within the region of the camera sensor, which, without the CPM, would have remained outside the inherent field of view of the system. To reconstruct the original object plane with N objects at their respective locations, the zero-padded object response pattern is deconvolved with the system's zero-padded and shifted point spread function. A simulation study followed by experimental results for N = 2 and N = 3 is presented in this article."}

Here we demonstrate a mechanically reconfigurable slow-light delay line based on a surface nanoscale axial photonics (SNAP) microresonator dynamically induced by controlled bending of a silica optical fiber. A localized nanoscale cutoff-wavelength dip, introduced by CO2-laser annealing, provides a reflective boundary, while fiber bending generates a smooth axial potential whose shape is continuously tunable via loop curvature. By adjusting the bending radius, the induced SNAP microresonator evolves from a nearly linear to an approximately semiparabolic axial profile, enabling a controlled transition from dispersive to nearly dispersionless delay. Using a transverse microfiber coupler operated at the impedance-matching condition, we experimentally demonstrate continuous delay tuning from 2 ns to 0.5 ns within a 10 GHz bandwidth in an approximately 2 mm long fiber segment, with insertion loss below 6 dB. The results confirm that mechanically induced SNAP microresonators provide a compact, robust, and reconfigurable platform for dispersion-engineered optical delay lines, with direct relevance to photonic beamforming, frequency-comb stabilization, and neuromorphic photonic signal processing."}

This work proposes a compact passive nonlinear photonic core based on a Side-Coupled Integrated Spaced Sequence of Resonators (SCISSOR) made of three nominally equal microrings and investigate its computing capabilities. Its nonlinearities and internal feedback enable analogue, spiking, and bistable responses that are accessed by tuning the injection power and wavelength. Implemented as a single nonlinear node in a time-multiplexed reservoir computing, the SCISSOR achieves error-free classification on the Iris dataset and accuracies above 97% on the Sonar task, using both analogue and digital reservoir representations with 150 virtual nodes. In the digital scheme, spiking dynamics naturally generate sparse reservoir states, enabling efficient classification even with a single spike. Intriguingly, optimal operating points are at the boundaries where sharp transitions in dynamical complexity and/or output power occur. In these points, the SCISSOR supports high task-performance, opening novel strategies for future on-chip training. Spiking and thermal bistabilities also participate to enhance the computational performance at low injected powers below 4 mW. These results suggest optical coupled microring resonators as effective building blocks for future edge computing and neuromorphic photonic systems."}

However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges associated with propagation loss, limited nonlinearity, and susceptibility to nanoscale fabrication imperfections prevent them from competing with conventional bulk and fiber-based OPAs. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient integrated OPAs with continuous-wave net gain. The pump efficiency is improved by over one order of magnitude. Phase-sensitive gain of 23.5 dB is demonstrated, significantly exceeding previous integrated OPAs, using only 110 mW pump power and no cavity enhancement. This is achieved with parametric down-conversion in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides using the adapted poling technique to maintain the coherence of nonlinear interactions. Moreover, the high parametric gain exceeds fibre-chip-fibre losses, leading to appreciable net gain up to 10 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 120 nm, covering telecommunication S-, C-, and Lbands. Quantum-limited noise performance is confirmed through the measurement of output field fluctuation below the classical limit. We further demonstrate that signalto-noise ratio in noisy optical communications can be increased by leveraging this efficient integrated OPA. Our work marks a significant step towards ideal optical amplifiers with strong amplification, high efficiency, quantum-limited noise, large bandwidth, and continuous-wave operation, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation photonic information processing systems."}
