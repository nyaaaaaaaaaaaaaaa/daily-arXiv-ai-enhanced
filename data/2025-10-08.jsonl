Over 180 W\nis achieved out to 2085 nm with <10% ASE content without utilizing in-line\nspectral filtering. The amplifier employs both Tm- and Tm/Ho-doped gain fibers\nin two preamplifier stages in addition to longer sections of Tm fiber to extend\nthe bandwidth of the Tm-based high-power amplifier to longer wavelengths (>2050\nnm). Efficiencies of 55% are realized across the full bandwidth. Roll-off\noccurs beyond 2085 nm where ASE becomes intractable. The amplifier has an\naverage M^2 value of 1.39 at high-power due to the presence of light guided\nwithin the fiber pedestal. Estimates of the pedestal light and higher-order\nmode contents are provided."}

Ömer Ilday"], "title": "Hierarchical self-assembly of Brownian particle-like pulses in a modelocked laser", "comment": "70 pages, 16 figures", "summary": "Passive modelocking involves self-locking of thousands of frequency modes to\nform ultrashort pulses. In fundamental modelocking, a single intracavity pulse\nprovides high stability and reproducibility, but limits the repetition rate.\nHarmonic modelocking can overcome this by supporting multiple pulses, but\nsuffers from instabilities and poor reproducibility, with specific states\nachievable only sporadically. Biology exploits hierarchy to organise\ncomplexity, which has inspired hierarchical self-assembly in the laboratory.\nHere, building on the Brownian-particle characteristics of modelocked pulses,\nwe introduce a theoretical framework that treats multi-pulse modelocking as a\nhierarchical self-assembly problem. This involves timescales spanning up to 14\norders of magnitude, yet with a natural hierarchy in which fast variables are\nslaved to slower ones. We exploit this hierarchy to reduce their complex\ndynamics into nested low-dimensional subsystems governing pulse shape, energy,\ngain, and positions. The resulting framework reveals how to reliably reach\ntarget states with precise pulse number and spacing. We experimentally validate\nthe predictions in a Mamyshev laser with over 100 pulses, limited only by\navailable power. Our framework could extend to spatiotemporal modelocking by\ntreating it as coupled pulses distributed across spatial modes and may also\nguide hierarchical strategies for laser-driven self-assembly."}

We increase the sampling frequency by employing a\nmagnifying objective to reconstruct the unwrapped phase with high accuracy for\nthe application of optical holography.

Growing demands for data throughput in 6G networks, timing\nprecision in positioning systems, and resolution in atmospheric sensing and\nautomotive radar have pushed receiver frontends into the millimeter-wave (mmW)\nand sub-mmW/THz regimes.

While early demonstrations used\nresonant devices and recent efforts have focused on cryogenic\nmicrowave-to-optical quantum transduction, room-temperature electro-optic\nreceivers have yet to achieve noise figures comparable to their electronic\ncounterparts.
