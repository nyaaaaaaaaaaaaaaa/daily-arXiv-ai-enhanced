Ion implantation into the top p-doped layer of a p-i-n diode creates high-resistivity tracks, providing electrical isolation between adjacent regions. Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model. Our results mark an important step towards scalable, multi-emitter architectures for chiral quantum networks."}

To address this, we recently demonstrated, by modifying Euler-angle parameterization, that an optical gadget consisting of two quarter-wave $q$-plates and one half-wave $q$-plate, each endowed with the same topological charge $q$, operates as a viable SU(2) gadget for the higher-order Poincaré sphere, contingent upon the fulfillment of the holonomy condition. This work presents the controlled navigation on the higher-order Poincaré sphere through the proposed architecture, formulated under the concept of an effective waveplate and thus can be referred to as an effective SU(2) gadget. The notion of an effective waveplate refers to a coaxial arrangement of multiple waveplates that, under specific constraints, can act as a single waveplate. In this gadget, the relative alignment of the offset angles of the constituent $q$-plates emerges as the decisive parameter governing systematic navigation on the higher-order Poincaré sphere. This study bear direct relevance to the deterministic control and engineering of structured light, encompassing polarization singularities, vector vortex beams and topological optical fields. Moreover, these results holds potential applications in the contemporary research frontiers in singular optics, spin-orbit photonics and quantum communication."}

Here, we track the spatiotemporal evolution of individual speckles and quantify fragmentation, localization, and persistence under different diffraction and turbulence scales. Beam fragmentation coincides with complete spatial decorrelation defined by the magnitude-squared coherence. Fragmentation occurs closer to the source for larger beams, which indicates that smaller beams are more robust to decoherence. Subsequently, speckles are both spatially localized and persistent over distances significantly longer than their associated Rayleigh length. The combination of localization and persistence impacts the statistics of light relevant to their long-distance signaling and sensing."}

However, they face challenges in sensing gases with high sensitivity due to weak light-gas interaction. Slow light, which dramatically intensifies light-matter interaction through spatial compression of optical energy, provides a promising solution. Herein, we demonstrate a dual slow-light scheme for enhancing the sensitivity of photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) with a suspended photonic crystal waveguide (PhCW) on a CMOS-compatible silicon platform. By tailoring the dispersion of the PhCW to generate structural slow light to enhance pump absorption and probe phase modulation, we achieve a photothermal efficiency of 3.6x10-4 rad cm ppm-1 mW-1 m-1, over 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than the strip waveguides and optical fibers. With a 1-mm-long sensing PhCW incorporated in a stabilized on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a footprint of 0.6 mm2, we demonstrate acetylene detection with a sensitivity of 1.4x10-6 in terms of noise-equivalent absorption and length product (NEAL), the best among the reported photonic waveguide gas sensors to our knowledge. The dual slow-light enhanced PTS paves the way for integrated photonic gas sensors with high sensitivity, miniaturization, and cost-effective mass production."}

Here, we demonstrate that tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) on insulator is a promising photonic material for such applications, supporting high-Q resonator architectures operating in the visible spectral range. The deposition process of Ta2O5 was optimized by examining the influence of oxygen flow on film stoichiometry during electron beam evaporation. High quality ring resonators (Q>10000) coupled to bus waveguides were fabricated and measured. Furthermore, we realised a hybrid Ta2O5 - hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) photonic device in which ensembles of B-centre defects were generated and preserved throughout fabrication. These results establish a robust material framework for the integration of defect-based quantum emitters with low-loss dielectric photonics."}

Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration."}

The Hamiltonian evolution ensures energy conservation and the final temperature is fully determined by the initial conditions. In this work we show that equilibration processes are radically different in lattices subject to discrete-step unitary evolution, which have been implemented in photonic circuits, coin polarisation walkers and time-multiplexed pulses in fibres. Using numerical simulations, we show that weak nonlinearities lead to an equilibrium state of equal modal occupation across all the bands, i.e, a thermal state with infinite temperature and chemical potential. This state is reached no matter the initial distribution of modes and independent of the bands dispersions and gaps. We show that by engineering the temporal periodicity inherent to these systems, equilibration can be accelerated through resonant Floquet channels. Our results demonstrate that discrete time plays a crucial role in wave dynamics, fundamentally altering thermalisation processes within weak wave turbulence theory."}

Reply to arXiv:2510.17949", "summary": "We recently reported a refine analysis of a previously conducted soft X-ray (SXR) attosecond streaking measurement [1], employing the Variational Phase Gradient Temporal Analysis (VPGTA) retreival algorithm [2]. This re-evaluation, prompted by new metrological insights, revealed a 19.2 attosecond pulse - consistent with the expectations and estimates of our earlier work [3]. Shortly thereafter, a comment by M. Han [4] challenged our findings, citing \"physical and technical issues concerning the original experiment and the new characterisation\" inclusing purported contributions from Auger electrons, unfiltered low-energy harmonics, and uncompensated intrinsic chirp. These concerns, however, stem from misinterpretation of the experimental regime, selective citation of context, and disregard for well-established results in the peer-reviewed literature. In this reply, we address and clarify these points, demonstrating that the issues raised are not relevant under our experimental conditions. Given the highly specialized nature of attosecond genertaion and metrology in the soft X-ray water-window regime, we consider it essential to clarify these aspects of different regimes and reaffirm teh validity of our conclusions."}

In previous works, signatures of topology have mainly been investigated from the perspective of edge states - strongly localised modes with exponentially decaying intensity into the bulk. While these edge states have become the hallmark of topological systems as they can facilitate non-reciprocal transport in potential applications, the topology is fundamentally encoded in the bulk band structure. In particular, the momentum-dependence of the eigenstates, i.e., the wave functions, determines the topology, usually reflected in a bulk band inversion. We present a band inversion in the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, characterised by a reversal of the sublattice symmetry, quantified by the expectation value $\\langle σ_\\mathrm{x} \\rangle$, when going from the centre of the Brillouin zone to the zone boundary. Here, we show direct experimental access to this bulk band inversion in SSH exciton-polariton chains, using two-dimensional momentum-space ($k$-space) mapping - without the need for real-space imaging. This technique enables the direct observation of the momentum-dependent inversion of the sublattice symmetry in the bulk bands, providing a unique perspective on topological phases beyond conventional edge state measurements. Our approach establishes effective momentum-resolved sublattice phase measurements as a powerful tool for accessing the wave function and bulk topology in photonic and polaritonic systems and beyond."}
