Most of the related\nresearch so far has assumed abrupt parameter profiles. This paper extends the\nfield to generalized graded-index (GRIN) interfaces, which are both more\npractical than ideal profiles and offer new avenues for wave manipulations. It\npresents an exact solution for wave propagation across arbitrary space-time\nmodulated GRIN interfaces and describes versatile chirping effects. The\nsolution is based on a generalization of the impulse response method from\nlinear time-invariant to linear space-time-varying systems. The proposed\nframework shows that space-time GRIN systems represent a novel approach for\ngenerating a new form of chirping that is not inherently based on dispersion,\nwith promising applications in pulse shaping and signal processing."}

While combining integrated\nphotonics materials enhances overall capability - such as unifying nonlinear\noptics, low-loss passive devices, and electro-optics - material and process\ncompatibility remains a major challenge. We introduce full-wafer, monolithic 3D\nintegration of tantalum pentoxide (Ta$_2$O$_5$, hereafter tantala) photonics\nonto arbitrary substrates, which we explore here with thin-film lithium niobate\n(LN) on silicon. Tantala's unique properties, importantly room-temperature\ndeposition, low-temperature annealing, and low stress in thick films optimized\nfor phase matching, make it well suited for monolithic 3D integration without\ncompromising substrate performance or compatibility. We demonstrate low-loss,\nhigh-quality-factor microresonators and nanophotonics in tantala, robust\nquasi-phase-matching in poled LN waveguides, and efficient 3D interlayer\nrouting. This enables us to demonstrate a rich palette of nonlinear frequency\nconversion processes, including $\\chi^{(3)}$ optical parametric oscillation\n(OPO) and soliton microcomb generation in tantala microresonators and\nphotonic-crystal resonators, $\\chi^{(2)}$ second-harmonic generation (SHG) in\nperiodically poled LN, and combinations thereof.

However, it can\nconverge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, thus\nunderscoring the need for robust diagnostics. Existing criteria, such as\nmonitoring the drift distribution or the Langevin-time operator, are valuable,\nbut they remain indirect. In this work, we propose a complementary reliability\ntest based on the configurational temperature. It is constructed from the\ngradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based checks, this\nestimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and thus offers a\nphysically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. To demonstrate that the\nestimator reproduces the input temperature with high precision, we use\none-dimensional PT-symmetric models as a controlled benchmark. We show that the\nestimator also sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and\nincomplete thermalization. While tested in low-dimensional systems, the method\nis readily extensible to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, where\nscalable approximations make its implementation practical. Since temperature is\ntied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring\ncan also serve as an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our\nresults suggest that configurational temperature can be integrated into a\nhybrid diagnostic framework, thus enhancing the robustness of CLM across a wide\nrange of applications, including future studies of lattice QCD at finite\ndensity."}

We input polarized dark-field\nscattering spectra and electron microscopy images into a dual-branch multimodal\nVAE with a single shared latent space trained on paired spectra-image data,\nusing a learnable linear adapter. We achieve prediction of Au NRs using only\npolarized dark-field scattering spectra input. We determine geometrical\nparameters of orientational angle and aspect ratio quantitatively via both\ndual-VAE and physics-based analysis. We show that orientational angle\nprediction by dual-VAE performs well with only a small (300 particle) training\nset, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.4 and a concordance correlation\ncoefficient (CCC) of 0.95.

When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as\nincubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event.\nIncubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as\nlaser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N\nexciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases\nwith N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant\nfor large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept\nbelow the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT\nincreases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser\nconditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power\nlaser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the\nmotivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to\nprevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or\nhigh-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the\nsculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the\nmechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling\nLID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter \"number of pulses\". We will\ngive an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There\nare several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation,\nand there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold\nfluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few\ncases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other.\nEventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world\nlaser machining."}

The $q$-plate features a spatially varying fast axis orientation\ndefined by two parameters: the topological charge $q$ and the offset angle\n$\\alpha_0$. The notion of an effective waveplate arises when multiple\nwaveplates, whether homogeneous or inhomogeneous, are aligned coaxially such\nthat, under specific constraints, the composite system emulates the behavior of\na single effective waveplate. This work presents a comprehensive mathematical\nformalism for realizing an effective waveplate through a cascaded configuration\nof three $q$-plates, each chosen as either a quarter-wave $q$-plate, a\nhalf-wave $q$-plate, or a combination thereof. This yields a total of eight\ndistinct configurations. Some configurations result in an effective waveplate\nexhibiting a constant retardance, whereas others allow continuous modulation of\nthe effective retardance over the full range from $0$ to $2\\pi$ through the\nsystematic variation of the relative offset angles between the constituent\n$q$-plates.
