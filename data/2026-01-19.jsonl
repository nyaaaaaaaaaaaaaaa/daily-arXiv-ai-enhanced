Herein, we propose a novel experimental scenario for investigating radiation RR within the classical radiation-dominated regime (CRDR), via the collision of a high-intensity petawatt-class laser with a tens-of-MeV electron beam from a LINAC. This approach enables access to a distinct parameter regime wherein RR dominates electron dynamics while quantum effects remain modest. Numerical simulations demonstrate that three key observables exist for identifying the RR within this CRDR regime: (i) quantitative measurement of energy spectra to validate the quantum correction factor; (ii) control of the collision time delay with charge-counting to map intensity dependence of RR; and (iii) verification of large angle ($90^\\circ$) photon emission under the recoil condition $2γ\\gtrsim a_0$. These experimental measurements will establish the benchmarks for RR models spanning the classical-to-quantum regime, thereby providing critical insights into fundamental strong-field quantum electrodynamics."}

By solving Maxwell's equations in covariant form, we show that torsion induces intrinsic chirality and circular birefringence: right- and left-circular polarizations acquire different wavenumbers, leading to a purely geometric optical activity. The polarization plane of a linearly polarized beam rotates according to the simple law $Δθ= ΩρL$, linear in the dislocation density $Ω$, propagation length $L$, and transverse coordinate $ρ$. This can be recast as an effective birefringence $Δn = 2cΩρ/ω$, providing geometric design rules for torsion-induced rotatory power. Using parameters from dislocated semiconductors, we obtain millidegree rotations over millimetre-scale paths, within reach of modern polarimetric techniques and amenable to enhancement in metamaterial platforms. We also show that the same spiral geometry implements a broadband geometric phase gate for polarization qubits and has an electronic analogue on the surface of cylindrical topological insulators, where torsion shears the Dirac cone, establishing a unified geometric link between torsion, optical activity, and topological electronic responses."}

Indeed, this progress has entailed investigations into various HCPCF designs, allowing for attaining diverse properties of interest such as ultralow loss, polarization filtering, and specific modal operation. Among HCPCFs with tailored modal characteristics are fibers displaying microstructures with modified symmetry, which allow for changing the loss hierarchy between the guided modes, hence favoring the propagation of higher-order modes. In this context, we here demonstrate the realization of an angle sensor utilizing a tubular HCPCF with a two-fold symmetric cladding. This specific fiber design enables the generation of an output intensity profile resulting from the superposition of LP01 and LP11-like modes, whose excitation and resulting output intensity spatial distribution are dependent on the polarization angle of the incident light. Thus, by rotating the input beam's polarization and analyzing the evolution of the resulting output profile, we characterized a rotation angle sensor exhibiting a sensitivity of 25 counts/degree and an estimated resolution of 0.3°. We understand that this work broadens the framework of HCPCF applications, demonstrating that symmetry-modified hollow-core fibers can act as a promising platform for advanced sensing scenarios and polarimetric characterizations."}

The coupling between PPs and NEs through the radiated optical field leads to establishment of a significant cross-correlation between NEs, so that their internal dynamics (photocurrent affected by the laser irradiation) depends on the NR's plasma frequency $ω_{p}$. The transition to this regime,combined with the nonlinearity of the system, leads to a steep increase of the photocurrent in the NEs, as well as to non-smooth (chimera-like or chaotic) behavior in the critical (transition) region, where small variations of $ω_{p}$ lead to significant changes in the level of the NE pairwise cross-correlations. The chimera-like state is realized as coexistence of locally synchronized and desynchronized NE dynamical states. A fit of the dependence of the critical current on $ω_{p}$ is found, being in agreement with results of numerical simulations. The critical effect may help to design new optical devices, using dispersive nanolattices which are made available by modern nanoelectronics."}

Building on but going beyond the scope of Ref.~\\cite{single_cycle_nlty_Letter}, we focus on dynamical features previously unexplored. Our formulation reveals clear signatures of quantum coherence in the net absorption dynamics and highlights the emergence of strong excited-state absorption under intense excitation.

Furthermore, we investigate the influence of pump pulse intensity on the local field's duration, spectral broadening and shift, and phase induced by carrier dynamics, highlighting the absorptive nature of the nonlinear response. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding nonlinear light-matter interaction in dispersive, low-density electron systems driven far from equilibrium by intense broadband excitation."}

Our lattice formulation employs clover fermions, a Symanzik-improved gauge action, and stout-smeared links, which suppress ultraviolet fluctuations and thus enable more accurate determinations of renormalization factors. Our methodology involves computing gauge-variant two-point and three-point Green's functions at one-loop order in lattice perturbation theory, in order to extract the multiplicative renormalization factors and the critical gluino mass. By analyzing lattice discretization effects on the axial current and their dependence on the stout-smearing and clover parameters, we identify a value of the smearing parameter that ensures axial-current conservation at one loop. The results presented in this work provide practical guidance for the fine-tuning procedures required to set up and calibrate lattice simulations of SYM."}

Furthermore, we demonstrate that such time interfaces can be utilized to generate large, highly localized quasistatic magnetic fields within the metasurfaces. The resulting nanoscale magnetization, supported by the residual circulating currents, persists after the departure of the time-scattered MGWs. We further demonstrate that the initial electromagnetic energy of the injected MGWs is partitioned between the time-reflected/refracted MGWs, residual motion of the free carriers, and a quasistatic magnetic field."}

These non-cavity modes are insensitive to the periodic index modulation of the Bragg reflectors, but arise from the cylindrical pillar geometry, as we show by comparison with simulations of uniform pillars, which reproduce the non-cavity modes.

At the same time, this range is extremely important, especially for biological and medical applications and for fundamental research. We used optical microresonators with whispering gallery modes made from various types of silicon crystals as a tool to study the loss mechanisms.

Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics."}

A primary challenge for Ge-based photoconductive antennas (PCAs), however, has been the long carrier lifetime of bulk Ge, preventing its use as a detector. Here, we demonstrate that amorphous Ge (a-Ge) films overcome this limitation, possessing inherent ultrashort carrier lifetimes ~ 1.11-1.38 ps. We leverage this property to demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, coherent THz pulse detection using undoped a-Ge-on-Si PCAs. We present a comparative study of devices fabricated on a-Ge films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and DC magnetron sputtering. The PECVD-Ge device, with better homogeneity and a smoother morphology in the films, demonstrates superior performance for both THz emission and detection. As an emitter, the PECVD-Ge PCA achieves a 40 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a bandwidth of ~ 3 THz. As a detector, it achieves a 32 dB SNR and a ~ 2 THz bandwidth, representing a ~2.5-fold increase in detected signal amplitude over the sputtered-Ge device. These results establish amorphous Ge-on-Si as a viable and scalable platform for both THz generation and detection, paving the way for fully integrated Si-based THz time-domain systems."}

Moreover, changes in experimental conditions over time mean that calibrating each component once is insufficient for maintaining long-term, high-quality field generation. To address this, we present a general engineering approach based on a bespoke, physically informed, and manifold-constrained gradient-descent scheme that enables in situ feedback control, compensating for such errors in real time without the need to alter the experimental setup.

This results in an overall continuous transformation potentially failing to be continuous at the level of the parameters of the cascade, leading to detrimental engineering consequences such as the introduction of complex, discontinuous aberrations that disrupt important topological properties of the underlying matter field. In this work, we establish a novel mathematical framework for analyzing the topological difficulties that emerge in the decomposition of an overall transformation into individual layers, and for determining the minimal depth required to overcome them.
